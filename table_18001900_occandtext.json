Jane Hall (February 7, 1802 \u2013 1892) was an American poet, essayist, and literary critic. None of her poems appeared in print until after she was twenty; they were then published anonymously in the Literary Gazette, and other periodicals. Dr. Park removed to Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1831, accompanied by his daughter, who lived with him until October 1840, when she married the Rev. E. B. Hall, of Providence, Rhode Island. Miriam, a Dramatic Sketch, her most notable work, was begun in the summer of 1826, finished the following summer, and published ten years later. Her other principal work is in prose, Joanna of Naples, an Historical Tale, published in 1838. Hannah, the Mother of Samuel the Prophet and Judge of Israel (1839) was, like Miriam, a verse play.\nEarly years and education\nLouisa Jane Park was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, February 7, 1802. Her parents were Dr. John Park and Louisa (Adams) Park. The father was a physician who had given up his medical practice when she was two, to move to Boston for the purpose of editing the New-England Repertory, a leading political journal of the Federal party.In a few years, he became weary of the conflict, then waged with so much violence, and, urged to do so by some of the most intelligent citizens, opened the Boston Lyceum for Young Ladies, in which a more thorough education might be received than was common in that period. His daughter was then in her tenth year. He had already made her familiar with Milton and Shakespere; and it was partly with the view of executing his plans for her education that he decided to become a public teacher. His school was opened in the spring of 1811, and for twenty years was eminently successful. His daughter, except when her studies were interrupted by ill-health (in early years, she showed symptoms of a delicate constitution), was eight years his pupil. She was an industrious scholar, and the thoroughness of her study shows itself all through her works by her chaste and correct style. She continued in her father's school until she was seventeen.\nCareer\nHer writings show that her mind was wisely as well as carefully disciplined, and probably her habits of composition were formed at an early period. She published nothing, however, until she was twenty years of age, and then anonymously, in the Literary Gazette, and other papers and magazines.In 1831, her father retired to Worcester, Massachusetts, carrying with him a library of some 3,000 volumes, containing many valuable works in Latin, French, and Italian. During her partial blindness, he read to her several hours every day, and assisted her in collecting the materials for her tale of Joanna of Naples, an Historical Tale (1838), and for a biographical notice of Elizabeth Carter, the English authoress.Samuel Austin Allibone said that few American poetical compositions were more highly commended than \"Miriam,\" Hall's finest work, which was written in 1826. She wrote it only for amusement, as she did many little poems and tales which she destroyed. The first half of this drama was read at a small literary party in Boston. The author, not being known, was present, and was encouraged by the remarks it occasioned to finish it in the following summer. Her father forbade her suggestion to burn it; it was read, as completed, in the winter of 1826, and the authorship disclosed, but she did not publish it for several years. She saw its defects more distinctly than before, when it appeared in print, and resolved never again to attempt anything so long in the form of poetry. Her eyesight failed for four or five years, during which time she was almost entirely deprived of the use of books, writing, and needlework. \"Miriam\" was published in 1837. It received the best approval of contemporary criticism, and a second edition, appeared in the following year. Hall had not proposed to herself to write a tragedy, but a dramatic poem, and the result was an instance of a successful accomplishment.On October 1, 1840, she married Rev. Edward B. Hall, a Unitarian minister of Providence, Rhode Island, where she was occupied with domestic affairs, and in the duties which grew out of her relation to her husband's society, to bestow much further attention upon literature. A volume of Hall's writings, entitled Verse and Prose, was published in 1850. Rev. Hall died in 1866, and his widow continued to reside in Providence until 1872, when she removed to Boston, where she resided thereafter.Hall lacked confidence in her own powers, and was always distrustful of the public reception of her articles. She would have written much more but for this reason, together with ill-health and impaired eye-sight.\nReferences\nAttribution\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Griswold, Rufus Wilmot (1852).

He served as a Whig member of Parliament from 1831 to 1841 and a Conservative from 1851 to 1866. He was Secretary of State for the Colonies from June 1858 to June 1859, choosing Richard Clement Moody as founder of British Columbia. He declined the Crown of Greece in 1862 after King Otto abdicated. He was created Baron Lytton of Knebworth in 1866. His marriage to the writer Rosina Bulwer Lytton broke down. Her detention in an insane asylum provoked a public outcry. Bulwer-Lytton's works sold and paid him well. He coined the phrases \"the great unwashed\", \"pursuit of the almighty dollar\", \"the pen is mightier than the sword\", and \"dweller on the threshold\", and the opening phrase \"It was a dark and stormy night.\" Yet his standing declined and he is little read today. The sardonic Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, held annually since 1982, claims to seek the \"opening sentence of the worst of all possible novels\".\nLife\nBulwer was born on 25 May 1803 to General William Earle Bulwer of Heydon Hall and Wood Dalling, Norfolk and Elizabeth Barbara Lytton, daughter of Richard Warburton Lytton of Knebworth House, Hertfordshire. He had two older brothers, William Earle Lytton Bulwer (1799\u20131877) and Henry (1801\u20131872), later Lord Dalling and Bulwer.His father died and his mother moved to London when he was four years old. When he was 15, a tutor named Wallington, who tutored him at Ealing, encouraged him to publish an immature work: Ishmael and Other Poems. Around this time, Bulwer fell in love, but the woman's father induced her to marry another man. She died about the time that Bulwer went to Cambridge and he stated that her loss affected all his subsequent life.In 1822 Bulwer-Lytton entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he met John Auldjo, but soon moved to Trinity Hall. In 1825 he won the Chancellor's Gold Medal for English verse. In the following year he took his BA degree and printed for private circulation a small volume of poems, Weeds and Wild Flowers. He purchased an army commission in 1826, but sold it in 1829 without serving.\nIn August 1827, he married Rosina Doyle Wheeler (1802\u20131882), a noted Irish beauty, but against the wishes of his mother, who withdrew his allowance, forcing him to work for a living. They had two children, Emily Elizabeth Bulwer-Lytton (1828\u20131848), and (Edward) Robert Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton (1831\u20131891) who became Governor-General and Viceroy of British India (1876\u20131880). His writing and political work strained their marriage and his infidelity embittered Rosina. In 1833 they separated acrimoniously and in 1836 the separation became legal. Three years later, Rosina published Cheveley, or the Man of Honour (1839), a near-libellous fiction satirising her husband's alleged hypocrisy. In June 1858, when her husband was standing as parliamentary candidate for Hertfordshire, she denounced him at the hustings. He retaliated by threatening her publishers, withholding her allowance and denying her access to their children. Finally he had her committed to a mental asylum, but she was released a few weeks later after a public outcry. This she chronicled in a memoir, A Blighted Life (1880). She continued attacking her husband's character for several years.\nThe death of Bulwer's mother in 1843 meant his \"exhaustion of toil and study had been completed by great anxiety and grief,\" and by \"about the January of 1844, I was thoroughly shattered.\" In his mother's room at Knebworth House, which he inherited, he \"had inscribed above the mantelpiece a request that future generations preserve the room as his beloved mother had used it.\" It remains hardly changed to this day. On 20 February 1844, in accordance with his mother's will, he changed his surname from Bulwer to Bulwer-Lytton and assumed the arms of Lytton by royal licence. His widowed mother had done the same in 1811. His brothers remained plain \"Bulwer\".\nBy chance Bulwer-Lytton encountered a copy of \"Captain Claridge's work on the \"Water Cure\", as practised by Priessnitz, at Graefenberg\", and \"making allowances for certain exaggerations therein\", pondered the option of travelling to Graefenberg, but preferred to find something closer to home, with access to his own doctors in case of failure: \"I who scarcely lived through a day without leech or potion!\". After reading a pamphlet by Doctor James Wilson, who operated a hydropathic establishment with James Manby Gully at Malvern, he stayed there for \"some nine or ten weeks\", after which he \"continued the system some seven weeks longer under Doctor Weiss, at Petersham\", then again at \"Doctor Schmidt's magnificent hydropathic establishment at Boppart\" (at the former Marienberg Convent at Boppard), after developing a cold and fever upon his return home.When Otto, King of Greece abdicated in 1862, Bulwer-Lytton was offered the Greek Crown, but declined.The English Rosicrucian society, founded in 1867 by Robert Wentworth Little, claimed Bulwer-Lytton as their \"Grand Patron\", but he wrote to the society complaining that he was \"extremely surprised\" by their use of the title, as he had \"never sanctioned such.\" Nevertheless, a number of esoteric groups have continued to claim Bulwer-Lytton as their own, chiefly because some of his writings \u2013 such as the 1842 book Zanoni \u2013 have included Rosicrucian and other esoteric notions. According to the Fulham Football Club, he once resided in the original Craven Cottage, today the site of their stadium.\nBulwer-Lytton had long suffered from a disease of the ear, and for the last two or three years of his life lived in Torquay nursing his health. After an operation to cure deafness, an abscess formed in the ear and burst; he endured intense pain for a week and died at 2\u00a0am on 18 January 1873, just short of his 70th birthday. The cause of death was unclear but it was thought the infection had affected his brain and caused a fit. Rosina outlived him by nine years. Against his wishes, Bulwer-Lytton was honoured with a burial in Westminster Abbey. His unfinished history Athens: Its Rise and Fall was published posthumously.\n\nPolitical career\nBulwer began his political career as a follower of Jeremy Bentham. In 1831 he was elected member for St Ives, Cornwall, after which he was returned for Lincoln in 1832, and sat in Parliament for that city for nine years. He spoke in favour of the Reform Bill and took the lead in securing the reduction, after vainly essaying the repeal, of the newspaper stamp duties. His influence was perhaps most keenly felt when, on the Whigs' dismissal from office in 1834, he issued a pamphlet entitled A Letter to a Late Cabinet Minister on the Crisis. Lord Melbourne, then Prime Minister, offered him a lordship of the Admiralty, which he declined as likely to interfere with his activity as an author.Bulwer was created a baronet, of Knebworth House in the County of Hertford, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom, in 1838. In 1841, he left Parliament and spent much of his time in travel. He did not return to politics until 1852, when having differed from Lord John Russell over the Corn Laws, he stood for Hertfordshire as a Conservative. Bulwer-Lytton held that seat until 1866, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Lytton of Knebworth in the County of Hertford. In 1858 he entered Lord Derby's government as Secretary of State for the Colonies, thus serving alongside his old friend Disraeli. He was comparatively inactive in the House of Lords.\"Just prior to his government's defeat in 1859 the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, notified Sir George Ferguson Bowen of his appointment as Governor of the new colony to be known as \u2018Queen's Land\u2019.\"  The draft letter was ranked #4 in the \u2018Top 150: Documenting Queensland\u2019 exhibition when it toured to venues around Queensland from February 2009 to April 2010. The exhibition was part of Queensland State Archives\u2019 events and exhibition program which contributed to the state's Q150 celebrations, marking the 150th anniversary of the separation of Queensland from New South Wales.\nBritish Columbia\nWhen news of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush reached London, Bulwer-Lytton, as Secretary of State for the Colonies, requested that the War Office recommend a field officer, \"a man of good judgement possessing a knowledge of mankind\", to lead a Corps of 150 (later increased to 172) Royal Engineers, who had been selected for their \"superior discipline and intelligence\". The War Office chose Richard Clement Moody, and Lord Lytton, who described Moody as his \"distinguished friend\", accepted the nomination in view of Moody's military record, his success as Governor of the Falkland Islands, and the distinguished record of his father, Colonel Thomas Moody, Knight at the Colonial Office. Moody was charged to establish British order and transform the newly established Colony of British Columbia (1858\u201366) into the British Empire's \"bulwark in the farthest west\" and \"found a second England on the shores of the Pacific.\" Lytton desired to send to the colony \"representatives of the best of British culture, not just a police force\": he sought men who possessed \"courtesy, high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world,\" and decided to send Moody, whom the Government considered to be the archetypal \"English gentleman and British Officer.\" at the head of the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, to whom he wrote an impassioned letter.The former HBC Fort Dallas at Camchin, the confluence of the Thompson and Fraser Rivers, was renamed in his honour by Governor Sir James Douglas in 1858 as Lytton, British Columbia.\nLiterary works\nBulwer-Lytton's literary career began in 1820 with the publication of a book of poems and spanned much of the 19th century. He wrote in a variety of genres, including historical fiction, mystery, romance, the occult and science fiction. He financed his extravagant way of life with a varied and prolific literary output, sometimes publishing anonymously. \nBulwer-Lytton published Falkland in 1827, a novel which was only a moderate success. But Pelham brought him public acclaim in 1828 and established his reputation as a wit and dandy. Its intricate plot and humorous, intimate portrayal of pre-Victorian dandyism kept gossips busy trying to associate public figures with characters in the book. Pelham resembled Benjamin Disraeli's first novel Vivian Grey (1827). The character of the villainous Richard Crawford in The Disowned, also published in 1828, borrowed much from that of banker and forger Henry Fauntleroy, who was hanged in London in 1824 before a crowd of some 100,000.Bulwer-Lytton admired Disraeli's father Isaac D'Israeli, himself a noted author. They began corresponding in the late 1820s and met for the first time in March 1830, when Isaac D'Israeli dined at Bulwer-Lytton's house. Also present that evening were Charles Pelham Villiers and Alexander Cockburn. The young Villiers had a long parliamentary career, while Cockburn became Lord Chief Justice of England in 1859.\nBulwer-Lytton reached his height of popularity with the publication of Godolphin (1833). This was followed by The Pilgrims of the Rhine (1834), The Last Days of Pompeii (1834), Rienzi, Last of the Roman Tribunes about Cola di Rienzo (1835), Ernest Maltravers; or, The Eleusinia (1837), Alice; or, The Mysteries (1838), Leila; or, The Siege of Granada (1838), and Harold, the Last of the Saxons (1848). The Last Days of Pompeii was inspired by Karl Briullov's painting The Last Day of Pompeii, which Bulwer-Lytton saw in Milan.His New Timon lampooned Tennyson, who responded in kind. Bulwer-Lytton also wrote the horror story The Haunted and the Haunters; or, The House and the Brain (1859). Another novel with a supernatural theme was A Strange Story (1862), which was an influence on Bram Stoker's Dracula.Bulwer-Lytton wrote many other works, including Vril: The Power of the Coming Race (1871) which drew heavily on his interest in the occult and contributed to the early growth of the science fiction genre. Its story of a subterranean race waiting to reclaim the surface of the Earth is an early science fiction theme. The book popularised the Hollow Earth theory and may have inspired Nazi mysticism. His term \"vril\" lent its name to Bovril meat extract. The book was also the theme of a fundraising event held at the Royal Albert Hall in 1891, the Vril-Ya Bazaar and Fete. \"Vril\" has been adopted by theosophists and occultists since the 1870s and became closely associated with the ideas of an esoteric neo-Nazism after 1945.His play Money (1840) was first produced at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, London, on 8 December 1840. The first American production was at the Old Park Theater in New York on 1 February 1841. Subsequent productions include the Prince of Wales's Theatre's in 1872 and as the inaugural play at the new California Theatre (San Francisco) in 1869.Among Bulwer-Lytton's lesser-known contributions to literature was that he convinced Charles Dickens to revise the ending of Great Expectations to make it more palatable to the reading public, as in the original version of the novel, Pip and Estella do not get together.\nLegacy\nQuotations\nBulwer-Lytton's most famous quotation is \"The pen is mightier than the sword\" from his play Richelieu:\n\nbeneath the rule of men entirely great, the pen is mightier than the sword\nHe popularized the phrase \"pursuit of the almighty dollar\" from his novel The Coming Race, and he is credited with \"the great unwashed\", using this disparaging term in his 1830 novel Paul Clifford:\n\nHe is certainly a man who bathes and \"lives cleanly\", (two especial charges preferred against him by Messrs. the Great Unwashed). \nTheosophy\nThe writers of theosophy were among those influenced by Bulwer-Lytton's work. Annie Besant and especially Helena Blavatsky incorporated his thoughts and ideas, particularly from The Last Days of Pompeii, Vril, the Power of the Coming Race and Zanoni in her own books.\nContest\nBulwer-Lytton's name lives on in the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, in which contestants think up terrible openings for imaginary novels, inspired by the first line of his 1830 novel Paul Clifford:\nIt was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents\u00a0\u2013 except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.\nEntrants in the contest seek to capture the rapid changes in point of view, the florid language, and the atmosphere of the full sentence. The opening was popularized by the Peanuts comic strip, in which Snoopy's sessions on the typewriter usually began with \"It was a dark and stormy night\". The same words also form the first sentence of Madeleine L'Engle's Newbery Medal-winning novel A Wrinkle in Time. Similar wording appears in Edgar Allan Poe's 1831 short story \"The Bargain Lost\", although not at the very beginning. It reads:\n\nIt was a dark and stormy night. The rain fell in cataracts; and drowsy citizens started, from dreams of the deluge, to gaze upon the boisterous sea, which foamed and bellowed for admittance into the proud towers and marble palaces. Who would have thought of passions so fierce in that calm water that slumbers all day long? At a slight alabaster stand, trembling beneath the ponderous tomes which it supported, sat the hero of our story.\nOperas\nSeveral of Bulwer-Lytton's novels were made into operas. One of them, Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen (1842) by Richard Wagner, eventually became more famous than the novel. Leonora (1846) by William Henry Fry, the first European-styled \"grand\" opera composed in the United States, is based on Bulwer-Lytton's play The Lady of Lyons, as is Frederic Cowen's first opera Pauline (1876). Verdi rival Errico Petrella's most successful opera, Jone (1858), was based upon Bulwer-Lytton's The Last Days of Pompeii, and was performed all over the world until the First World War. Harold, the Last of the Saxons (1848) was the source for Verdi's opera Aroldo in 1857.\nTheatrical adaptations\nShortly after their first publication, The Last Days of Pompeii, Rienzi, and Ernest Maltravers all received successful stage performances in New York.\nThe plays were written by Louisa Medina, one of the most successful playwrights of the 19th century. The Last Days of Pompeii had the longest continuous stage run in New York at the time with 29 straight performances.\nMagazines\nIn addition to his political and literary work, Bulwer-Lytton became the editor of the New Monthly in 1831, but he resigned the following year. In 1841, he started the Monthly Chronicle, a semi-scientific magazine. During his career he wrote poetry, prose, and stage plays; his last novel was Kenelm Chillingly, which was in course of publication in Blackwood's Magazine at the time of his death in 1873.\nTranslations\nBulwer-Lytton's works of fiction and non-fiction were translated in his day and since then into many languages, including Serbian (by Laza Kostic), German, Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, French, Finnish, and Spanish. In 1879, his Ernest Maltravers was the first complete novel from the West to be translated into Japanese.\nPlace names\nIn Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, the suburb of Lytton, the town of  Bulwer on Moreton Island (Moorgumpin) and the neighbourhood (former island) of  Bulwer Island are named after him. The township of Lytton, Quebec (today part of Montcerf-Lytton) was named after him as was Lytton, British Columbia, and Lytton, Iowa. Lytton Road in Gisborne, New Zealand was named after the novelist. Later a state secondary school, Lytton High School, was founded in the road.\nPortrayal on television\nBulwer-Lytton was portrayed by the actor Brett Usher in the 1978 television serial Disraeli.\nWorks by Bulwer-Lytton\nNovels\nVerse\nIsmael (1820)\nThe Poems and Ballads of Schiller, translator (1844), published by Bernard Tauchnitz, Leipzig\nThe New Timon (1846), an attack on Tennyson published anonymously\nKing Arthur (1848\u20131849)Plays\n\nSee also\nBulwer-Lytton and Theosophy\nLytton, QueenslandReferences\nFurther reading\nChristensen, Allan Conrad (1976).

He specialised in mystery tales that explored hidden motivation and hinted at evil without being explicitly concerned with anything supernatural. He had a decisive influence on writers such as Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, Henry James, Leon Bloy, and Marcel Proust.\n\nBiography\nJules-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Barbey \u2014 the d'Aurevilly was a later inheritance from a childless uncle \u2014 was born at Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte, Manche in Lower Normandy. In 1827 he went to the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas de Paris. After getting his baccalaur\u00e9at in 1829, he went to Caen University to study law, taking his degree three years later. As a young man, he was a liberal and an atheist, and his early writings present religion as something that meddles in human affairs only to complicate and pervert matters. In the early 1840s, however, he began to frequent the Catholic and legitimist salon of Baroness Amaury de Maistre, niece of Joseph de Maistre. In 1846 he converted to Roman Catholicism.\nHis greatest successes as a literary writer date from 1852 onwards, when he became an influential literary critic at the Bonapartist paper Le Pays, helping to rehabilitate Balzac and effectually promoting Stendhal, Flaubert, and Baudelaire. Paul Bourget describes Barbey as an idealist, who sought and found in his work a refuge from the uncongenial ordinary world. Jules Lema\u00eetre, a less sympathetic critic, thought the extraordinary crimes of his heroes and heroines, his reactionary opinions, his dandyism and snobbery were a caricature of Byronism.\nBeloved of fin-de-si\u00e8cle decadents, Barbey d'Aurevilly remains an example of the extremes of late romanticism. Barbey d'Aurevilly held strong Catholic opinions, yet wrote about risqu\u00e9 subjects, a contradiction apparently more disturbing to the English than to the French themselves. Barbey d'Aurevilly was also known for having constructed his own persona as a dandy, adopting an aristocratic style and hinting at a mysterious past, though his parentage was provincial bourgeois nobility, and his youth comparatively uneventful. Inspired by the character and ambience of Valognes, he set his works in the society of Normand aristocracy. Although he himself did not use the Norman patois, his example encouraged the revival of vernacular literature in his home region.\nJules-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Barbey d'Aurevilly died in Paris and was buried in the cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse. During 1926 his remains were transferred to the churchyard in Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte.\n\nWorks\nHis complete works are published in two volumes of the Biblioth\u00e8que de la Pl\u00e9iade.\n\nQuotations\n\"Next to the wound, what women make best is the bandage.\"\n\"The mortal envelope of the Middle Age has disappeared, but the essential remains. Because the temporal disguise has fallen, the dupes of history and of its dates say that the Middle Age is dead. Does one die for changing his shirt?\"\n\"In France everybody is an aristocrat, for everybody aims to be distinguished from everybody. The red cap of the Jacobins is the red heel of the aristocrats at the other extremity, but it is the same distinctive sign. Only, as they hated each other, Jacobinism placed on its head what aristocracy placed under its foot.\"\n\"In the matter of literary form it is the thing poured in the vase which makes the beauty of the vase, otherwise there is nothing more than a vessel.\"\n\"Books must be set against books, as poisons against poisons.\"\n\"When superior men are mistaken they are superior in that as in all else. They see more falsely than small or mediocre minds.\"\n\"The Orient and Greece recall to my mind the saying, so coloured and melancholic, of Richter: 'Blue is the colour of mourning in the Orient. That is why the sky of Greece is so beautiful'.\"\n\"Men give their measure by their admiration, and it is by their judgements that one may judge them.\"\n\"The most beautiful destiny: to have genius and be obscure.\"Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nCharles Baudelaire\nJoris-Karl HuysmansNotes\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nWorks by Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \nWorks by or about Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly at Internet Archive\nWorks by Barbey d'Aurevilly, at Hathi Trust\nJules-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Barbey d\u2019Aurevilly: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\nJules-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Barbey d\u2019Aurevilly: Encyclop\u00e9die de L'Agora\nChisholm, Hugh, ed.

Some of his novels, including his first, Sous les Tilleuls (1832), were autobiographical romances. A second novel, Une heure trop tard, followed next year, and was succeeded by many other popular works. His Vendredi soir (1835) and Le Chemin le plus court (1836) continued the vein of autobiographical romance with which he had made his first success. Genevi\u00e8ve (1838) is one of his best stories, and his Voyage autour de mon jardin (1845) was deservedly popular. Others were Feu Bressier (1848), and Fort en th\u00e8me (1853), which had some influence in stimulating educational reform.\nIn 1839, Karr became editor of Le Figaro, to which he had been a constant contributor; and he also started a monthly journal, Les Gu\u00eapes, of a keenly satirical tone, a publication which brought him the reputation of a somewhat bitter wit. His epigrams are frequently quoted, for example \"plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose\", or \"the more things change, the more they continue to be the same thing, usually translated as \"the more things change, the more they stay the same\" (Les Gu\u00eapes, July 1848). On the proposal to abolish capital punishment, \"je veux bien que messieurs les assassins commencent\", i.e. \"let the gentlemen who do the murders take the first step\".\nIn 1848, he founded Le Journal. In 1855 he went to live in Nice, where he indulged his predilections for floriculture, and gave his name to more than one new variety, notably the dahlia (New International Encyclopedia). Indeed, he practically founded the trade in cut flowers on the French Riviera. He was also devoted to fishing, and in Les Soir\u00e9es de Sainte-Adresse (1853) and Au bord de la mer (1860) he made use of his experiences. His reminiscences, Livre de bord, were published in 1879\u20131880. He died at Saint-Rapha\u00ebl (Var).\n\nFamily\nKarr's brother Eug\u00e8ne was a talented engineer, and his niece Carme Karr was a writer, journalist and suffragist in La Roche-Mabile.In April 1832, Karr had a shortlived relationship with actress Juliette Drouet. He allegedly borrowed all of her money and never paid it back. Karr was married to Louise Estelle Cl\u00e9mentine (n\u00e9e Renard de Mentule, born 9 December 1815). They first met in late 1833, and married on 10 February 1834. Their first and only child, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, was born on 2 September 1834.

Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and of American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. He is also generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. Poe was the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Poe. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as Poe and John Allan repeatedly clashed over Poe's debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of Poe's education. Poe attended the University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money. He quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the United States Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time that his publishing career began with the anonymous collection Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to \"a Bostonian\". Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife in 1829. Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and he ultimately parted ways with Allan.\nPoe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. He married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm, in 1836, but Virginia died of tuberculosis in 1847. In January 1845, Poe published his poem \"The Raven\" to instant success. He planned for years to produce his own journal The Penn (later renamed The Stylus), but before it could be produced, he died in Baltimore on October 7, 1849, at age 40. The cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to disease, alcoholism, substance abuse, suicide, and other causes.Poe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. He and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.\n\nEarly life\nEdgar Poe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 19, 1809, the second child of English-born actress Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe and actor David Poe Jr. He had an elder brother named William Henry Leonard Poe and a younger sister named Rosalie Poe. Their grandfather, David Poe Sr., emigrated from County Cavan, Ireland, around 1750. Edgar may have been named after a character in William Shakespeare's King Lear, which the couple were performing in 1809. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died a year later from consumption (pulmonary tuberculosis). Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful merchant in Richmond, Virginia, who dealt in a variety of goods, including cloth, wheat, tombstones, tobacco, and slaves. The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name \"Edgar Allan Poe\", though they never formally adopted him.The Allan family had Poe baptized into the Episcopal Church in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son. The family sailed to the United Kingdom in 1815, and Poe attended the grammar school for a short period in Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland (where Allan was born) before rejoining the family in London in 1816. There he studied at a boarding school in Chelsea until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby's Manor House School at Stoke Newington, then a suburb 4 miles (6\u00a0km) north of London.Poe moved with the Allans back to Richmond in 1820. In 1824, he served as the lieutenant of the Richmond youth honor guard as the city celebrated the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette. In March 1825, Allan's uncle and business benefactor William Galt died, who was said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond, leaving Allan several acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000 (equivalent to $17,000,000 in 2019). By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick house called Moldavia.Poe may have become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he registered at the University of Virginia in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages. The university was in its infancy, established on the ideals of its founder Thomas Jefferson. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were mostly ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate. During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. He claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased. Poe gave up on the university after a year but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married another man, Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer, and he started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet during this period.\nMilitary career\nPoe was unable to support himself, so he enlisted in the United States Army as a private on May 27, 1827, using the name \"Edgar A. Perry\". He claimed that he was 22 years old even though he was 18. He first served at Fort Independence in Boston Harbor for five\u00a0dollars a month. That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry titled Tamerlane and Other Poems, attributed with the byline \"by a Bostonian\". Only 50\u00a0copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention. Poe's regiment was posted to Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina and traveled by ship on the brig Waltham on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to \"artificer\", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for artillery, and had his monthly pay doubled. He served for two\u00a0years and attained the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank that a non-commissioned officer could achieve); he then sought to end his five-year enlistment early. Poe revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard, who would only allow Poe to be discharged if he reconciled with Allan. Poe wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic and spent several months ignoring Poe's pleas; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife's death, Allan agreed to support Poe's attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.Poe was finally discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him. Before entering West Point, he moved back to Baltimore for a time to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter Virginia Eliza Clemm (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe. In September of that year Poe received \u201cthe very first words of encouragement I ever remember to have heard\u201d in a review of his poetry by influential critic John Neal, prompting Poe to dedicate one of the poems to Neal in his second book Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems, published in Baltimore in 1829.Poe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830. In October 1830, Allan married his second wife Louisa Patterson. The marriage and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of extramarital affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe. Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. He tactically pleaded not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.Poe left for New York in February 1831 and released a third volume of poems, simply titled Poems. The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, many of whom donated 75\u00a0cents to the cause, raising a total of $170. They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones that Poe had been writing about commanding officers. It was printed by Elam Bliss of New York, labeled as \"Second Edition,\" and including a page saying, \"To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated\". The book once again reprinted the long poems \"Tamerlane\" and \"Al Aaraaf\" but also six previously unpublished poems, including early versions of \"To Helen\", \"Israfel\", and \"The City in the Sea\". Poe returned to Baltimore to his aunt, brother, and cousin in March 1831. His elder brother Henry had been in ill health, in part due to problems with alcoholism, and he died on August 1, 1831.\nPublishing career\nAfter his brother's death, Poe began more earnest attempts to start his career as a writer, but he chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so. He was one of the first Americans to live by writing alone and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law. American publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues. Publishers often refused to pay their writers or paid them much later than they promised, and Poe repeatedly resorted to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.\nAfter his early attempts at poetry, Poe had turned his attention to prose, likely based on John Neal's critiques in The Yankee magazine. He placed a few stories with a Philadelphia publication and began work on his only drama Politian. The Baltimore Saturday Visiter awarded him a prize in October 1833 for his short story \"MS. Found in a Bottle\". The story brought him to the attention of John P. Kennedy, a Baltimorean of considerable means who helped Poe place some of his stories and introduced him to Thomas W. White, editor of the Southern Literary Messenger in Richmond. Poe became assistant editor of the periodical in August 1835, but White discharged him within a few weeks for being drunk on the job. Poe returned to Baltimore where he obtained a license to marry his cousin Virginia on September 22, 1835, though it is unknown if they were married at that time. He was 26 and she was 13.\nPoe was reinstated by White after promising good behavior, and he went back to Richmond with Virginia and her mother. He remained at the Messenger until January 1837. During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500. He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia held a Presbyterian wedding ceremony at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm's age as 21.Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was published and widely reviewed in 1838. In the summer of 1839, Poe became assistant editor of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing his reputation as a trenchant critic which he had established at the Messenger. Also in 1839, the collection Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque was published in two volumes, though he made little money from it and it received mixed reviews.In June 1840, Poe published a prospectus announcing his intentions to start his own journal called The Stylus, although he originally intended to call it The Penn, as it would have been based in Philadelphia. He bought advertising space for his prospectus in the June 6, 1840 issue of Philadelphia's Saturday Evening Post: \"Prospectus of the Penn Magazine, a Monthly Literary journal to be edited and published in the city of Philadelphia by Edgar A. Poe.\" The journal was never produced before Poe's death.\nPoe left Burton's after about a year and found a position as writer and co-editor at the then-very-successful monthly Graham's Magazine. In the last number of Graham's for 1841, Poe was among the co-signatories to an editorial note of celebration of the tremendous success that magazine had achieved in the past year: \"Perhaps the editors of no magazine, either in America or in Europe, ever sat down, at the close of a year, to contemplate the progress of their work with more satisfaction than we do now. Our success has been unexampled, almost incredible. We may assert without fear of contradiction that no periodical ever witnessed the same increase during so short a period.\"Around this time, Poe attempted to secure a position within the administration of President John Tyler, claiming that he was a member of the Whig Party. He hoped to be appointed to the United States Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler's son Robert, an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas. Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk. Poe was promised an appointment, but all positions were filled by others.\nOne evening in January 1842, Virginia showed the first signs of consumption, now known as tuberculosis, while singing and playing the piano, which Poe described as breaking a blood vessel in her throat. She only partially recovered, and Poe began to drink more heavily under the stress of her illness. He left Graham's and attempted to find a new position, for a time angling for a government post. He returned to New York where he worked briefly at the Evening Mirror before becoming editor of the Broadway Journal, and later its owner. There Poe alienated himself from other writers by publicly accusing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism, though Longfellow never responded. On January 29, 1845, his poem \"The Raven\" appeared in the Evening Mirror and became a popular sensation. It made Poe a household name almost instantly, though he was paid only $9 for its publication. It was concurrently published in The American Review: A Whig Journal under the pseudonym \"Quarles\".The Broadway Journal failed in 1846, and Poe moved to a cottage in Fordham, New York, in what is now the Bronx. That home is now known as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage, relocated to a park near the southeast corner of the Grand Concourse and Kingsbridge Road. Nearby, Poe befriended the Jesuits at St. John's College, now Fordham University. Virginia died at the cottage on January 30, 1847. Biographers and critics often suggest that Poe's frequent theme of the \"death of a beautiful woman\" stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his wife.Poe was increasingly unstable after his wife's death. He attempted to court poet Sarah Helen Whitman who lived in Providence, Rhode Island. Their engagement failed, purportedly because of Poe's drinking and erratic behavior. There is also strong evidence that Whitman's mother intervened and did much to derail their relationship. Poe then returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster.\nDeath\nOn October 3, 1849, Poe was found delirious on the streets of Baltimore, \"in great distress, and\u2026 in need of immediate assistance\", according to Joseph W. Walker, who found him. He was taken to the Washington Medical College, where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849, at 5:00 in the morning. Poe was not coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in his dire condition and was wearing clothes that were not his own. He is said to have repeatedly called out the name \"Reynolds\" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. Some sources say that Poe's final words were, \"Lord help my poor soul\". All medical records have been lost, including Poe's death certificate.Newspapers at the time reported Poe's death as \"congestion of the brain\" or \"cerebral inflammation\", common euphemisms for death from disreputable causes such as alcoholism. The actual cause of death remains a mystery. Speculation has included delirium tremens, heart disease, epilepsy, syphilis, meningeal inflammation, cholera, and rabies. One theory dating from 1872 suggests that cooping was the cause of Poe's death, a form of electoral fraud in which citizens were forced to vote for a particular candidate, sometimes leading to violence and even murder.\nGriswold's \"Memoir\"\nImmediately after Poe's death, his literary rival Rufus Wilmot Griswold wrote a slanted high-profile obituary under a pseudonym, filled with falsehoods that cast him as a lunatic and a madman, and which described him as a person who \"walked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips moving in indistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate prayers, (never for himself, for he felt, or professed to feel, that he was already damned)\".The long obituary appeared in the New York Tribune signed \"Ludwig\" on the day that Poe was buried. It was soon further published throughout the country. The piece began, \"Edgar Allan Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore the day before yesterday. This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it.\" \"Ludwig\" was soon identified as Griswold, an editor, critic, and anthologist who had borne a grudge against Poe since 1842. Griswold somehow became Poe's literary executor and attempted to destroy his enemy's reputation after his death.Griswold wrote a biographical article of Poe called \"Memoir of the Author\", which he included in an 1850 volume of the collected works. There he depicted Poe as a depraved, drunken, drug-addled madman and included Poe's letters as evidence. Many of his claims were either lies or distortions; for example, it is seriously disputed that Poe was a drug addict. Griswold's book was denounced by those who knew Poe well, including John Neal, who published an article defending Poe and attacking Griswold as a \"Rhadamanthus, who is not to be bilked of his fee, a thimble-full of newspaper notoriety\". Griswold's book nevertheless became a popularly accepted biographical source. This was in part because it was the only full biography available and was widely reprinted, and in part because readers thrilled at the thought of reading works by an \"evil\" man. Letters that Griswold presented as proof were later revealed as forgeries.\nLiterary style and themes\nGenres\nPoe's best known fiction works are Gothic, adhering to the genre's conventions to appeal to the public taste. His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Many of his works are generally considered part of the dark romanticism genre, a literary reaction to transcendentalism which Poe strongly disliked. He referred to followers of the transcendental movement as \"Frog-Pondians\", after the pond on Boston Common, and ridiculed their writings as \"metaphor\u2014run mad,\" lapsing into \"obscurity for obscurity's sake\" or \"mysticism for mysticism's sake\". Poe once wrote in a letter to Thomas Holley Chivers that he did not dislike transcendentalists, \"only the pretenders and sophists among them\".Beyond horror, Poe also wrote satires, humor tales, and hoaxes. For comic effect, he used irony and ludicrous extravagance, often in an attempt to liberate the reader from cultural conformity. \"Metzengerstein\" is the first story that Poe is known to have published and his first foray into horror, but it was originally intended as a burlesque satirizing the popular genre. Poe also reinvented science fiction, responding in his writing to emerging technologies such as hot air balloons in \"The Balloon-Hoax\".Poe wrote much of his work using themes aimed specifically at mass-market tastes. To that end, his fiction often included elements of popular pseudosciences, such as phrenology and physiognomy.\nLiterary theory\nPoe's writing reflects his literary theories, which he presented in his criticism and also in essays such as \"The Poetic Principle\". He disliked didacticism and allegory, though he believed that meaning in literature should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface. Works with obvious meanings, he wrote, cease to be art. He believed that work of quality should be brief and focus on a specific single effect. To that end, he believed that the writer should carefully calculate every sentiment and idea.Poe describes his method in writing \"The Raven\" in the essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\", and he claims to have strictly followed this method. It has been questioned whether he really followed this system, however. T. S. Eliot said: \"It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method.\" Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as \"a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization\".\nLegacy\nInfluence\nDuring his lifetime, Poe was mostly recognized as a literary critic. Fellow critic James Russell Lowell called him \"the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America\", suggesting\u2014rhetorically\u2014that he occasionally used prussic acid instead of ink. Poe's caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a \"tomahawk man\". A favorite target of Poe's criticism was Boston's acclaimed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was often defended by his literary friends in what was later called \"The Longfellow War\". Poe accused Longfellow of \"the heresy of the didactic\", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized. Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow's reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, \"We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future\".Poe was also known as a writer of fiction and became one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States. Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work throughout Europe.Poe's early detective fiction tales featuring C. Auguste Dupin laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, \"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\" The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the genre the \"Edgars\". Poe's work also influenced science fiction, notably Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket called An Antarctic Mystery, also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields. Science fiction author H. G. Wells noted, \"Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago\". In 2013, The Guardian cited Pym as one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Doyle, Henry James, B. Traven, and David Morrell.Horror author and historian H. P. Lovecraft was heavily influenced by Poe's horror tales, dedicating an entire section of his long essay, \u201cSupernatural Horror in Literature\u201d, to his influence on the genre. In his letters, Lovecraft stated, \u201cWhen I write stories, Edgar Allan Poe is my model.\u201d Alfred Hitchcock once said, \"It's because I liked Edgar Allan Poe's stories so much that I began to make suspense films\".Like many famous artists, Poe's works have spawned imitators. One trend among imitators of Poe has been claims by clairvoyants or psychics to be \"channeling\" poems from Poe's spirit. One of the most notable of these was Lizzie Doten, who published Poems from the Inner Life in 1863, in which she claimed to have \"received\" new compositions by Poe's spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous Poe poems such as \"The Bells\", but which reflected a new, positive outlook.\nEven so, Poe has also received criticism. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal character and its influence upon his reputation. William Butler Yeats was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him \"vulgar\". Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson reacted to \"The Raven\" by saying, \"I see nothing in it\", and derisively referred to Poe as \"the jingle man\". Aldous Huxley wrote that Poe's writing \"falls into vulgarity\" by being \"too poetical\"\u2014the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger.It is believed that only twelve copies have survived of Poe's first book Tamerlane and Other Poems. In December 2009, one copy sold at Christie's auctioneers in New York City for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.\nPhysics and cosmology\nEureka: A Prose Poem, an essay written in 1848, included a cosmological theory that presaged the Big Bang theory by 80 years, as well as the first plausible solution to Olbers' paradox.\nPoe eschewed the scientific method in Eureka and instead wrote from pure intuition. For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science, but insisted that it was still true and considered it to be his career masterpiece. Even so, Eureka is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.\nCryptography\nPoe had a keen interest in cryptography. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper Alexander's Weekly (Express) Messenger, inviting submissions of ciphers which he proceeded to solve. In July 1841, Poe had published an essay called \"A Few Words on Secret Writing\" in Graham's Magazine. Capitalizing on public interest in the topic, he wrote \"The Gold-Bug\" incorporating ciphers as an essential part of the story. Poe's success with cryptography relied not so much on his deep knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple substitution cryptogram) as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage. The sensation that Poe created with his cryptography stunts played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.Two ciphers he published in 1841 under the name \"W. B. Tyler\" were not solved until 1992 and 2000 respectively. One was a quote from Joseph Addison's play Cato; the other is probably based on a poem by Hester Thrale.Poe had an influence on cryptography beyond increasing public interest during his lifetime. William Friedman, America's foremost cryptologist, was heavily influenced by Poe. Friedman's initial interest in cryptography came from reading \"The Gold-Bug\" as a child, an interest that he later put to use in deciphering Japan's PURPLE code during World War II.\nIn popular culture\nAs a character\nThe historical Edgar Allan Poe has appeared as a fictionalized character, often representing the \"mad genius\" or \"tormented artist\" and exploiting his personal struggles. Many such depictions also blend in with characters from his stories, suggesting that Poe and his characters share identities. Often, fictional depictions of Poe use his mystery-solving skills in such novels as The Poe Shadow by Matthew Pearl.\nPreserved homes, landmarks, and museums\n\n\nNo childhood home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family's Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the Edgar Allan Poe Museum, though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items that Poe used during his time with the Allan family, and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. 13 West Range is the dorm room that Poe is believed to have used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826; it is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is now overseen by a group of students and staff known as the Raven Society.The earliest surviving home in which Poe lived is in Baltimore, preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum. Poe is believed to have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with Maria Clemm and Virginia (as well as his grandmother and possibly his brother William Henry Leonard Poe). It is open to the public and is also the home of the Edgar Allan Poe Society. Of the several homes that Poe, his wife Virginia, and his mother-in-law Maria rented in Philadelphia, only the last house has survived. The Spring Garden home, where the author lived in 1843\u20131844, is today preserved by the National Park Service as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site. Poe's final home is preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage in the Bronx.In Boston, a commemorative plaque on Boylston Street is several blocks away from the actual location of Poe's birth. The house which was his birthplace at 62 Carver Street no longer exists; also, the street has since been renamed \"Charles Street South\". A \"square\" at the intersection of Broadway, Fayette, and Carver Streets had once been named in his honor, but it disappeared when the streets were rearranged. In 2009, the intersection of Charles and Boylston Streets (two blocks north of his birthplace) was designated \"Edgar Allan Poe Square\".In March 2014, fundraising was completed for construction of a permanent memorial sculpture, known as \"Poe Returning to Boston,\" at this location. The winning design by Stefanie Rocknak depicts a life-sized Poe striding against the wind, accompanied by a flying raven; his suitcase lid has fallen open, leaving a \"paper trail\" of literary works embedded in the sidewalk behind him. The public unveiling on October 5, 2014 was attended by former U.S. poet laureate Robert Pinsky.Other Poe landmarks include a building on the Upper West Side where Poe temporarily lived when he first moved to New York. A plaque suggests that Poe wrote \"The Raven\" here. On Sullivan's Island in Charleston, South Carolina, the setting of Poe's tale \"The Gold-Bug\" and where Poe served in the Army in 1827 at Fort Moultrie, there is a restaurant called Poe's Tavern. In Fell's Point, Baltimore, a bar still stands where legend says that Poe was last seen drinking before his death. Now known as \"The Horse You Came in On\", local lore insists that a ghost whom they call \"Edgar\" haunts the rooms above.\nPhotographs\nEarly daguerreotypes of Poe continue to arouse great interest among literary historians. Notable among them are:\n\n\"Ultima Thule\" (\"far discovery\") to honor the new photographic technique; taken in November 1848 in Providence, Rhode Island, probably by Edwin H. Manchester\n\"Annie\", given to Poe's friend Annie L. Richmond; probably taken in June 1849 in Lowell, Massachusetts, photographer unknownPoe Toaster\nBetween 1949 and 2009, a bottle of cognac and three roses were left at Poe's original grave marker every January 19 by an unknown visitor affectionately referred to as the \"Poe Toaster\". Sam Porpora was a historian at the Westminster Church in Baltimore where Poe is buried, and he claimed on August 15, 2007 that he had started the tradition in 1949. Porpora said that the tradition began in order to raise money and enhance the profile of the church. His story has not been confirmed, and some details which he gave to the press are factually inaccurate. The Poe Toaster's last appearance was on January 19, 2009, the day of Poe's bicentennial.\nList of selected works\nOther works\n\nPolitian (1835)\u00a0\u2013 Poe's only play\nThe Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838)\u00a0\u2013 Poe's only complete novel\n\"The Balloon-Hoax\" (1844)\u00a0\u2013 A journalistic hoax printed as a true story\n\"The Philosophy of Composition\" (1846)\u00a0\u2013 Essay\nEureka: A Prose Poem (1848)\u00a0\u2013 Essay\n\"The Poetic Principle\" (1848)\u00a0\u2013 Essay\n\"The Light-House\" (1849)\u00a0\u2013 Poe's last, incomplete workSee also\nEdgar Allan Poe and music\nEdgar Allan Poe in television and film\nEdgar Allan Poe in popular culture\nList of coupled cousins\nUSS E.A.

In 1824, he graduated from the cadet corps in Kalisz, and in 1829 from the military school in Warsaw. During his time at the school, he developed an interest in literature, reading the French classics and romantic poetry. He also learned foreign languages, and was able to read in French, German and English. In 1830 he released his first publication, a psychological essay about animal magnetism. He participated in the November Uprising. In the Battle of Grochow in 1831 he was taken prisoner by the Russians and sent to Wiatka (now Kirov).\nIn 1832 he joined the Russian army. During the years 1832 to 1834 he served in Finland. During his stay there he wrote a diary, now preserved only in fragments. In 1834, he enrolled in the military academy in St. Petersburg. Around 1838 he married Eleanor Janowska. During the 1840s, he published fiction, mostly under the name of his wife Eleanor Sztyrmer. He wrote a series of strange novellas, mostly centered around the character of Mr. Pantofel (or Mr. Slipper). He was a member of St. Petersburg society during the years 1842 to 1845, and published journalistic pieces in the Weekly Petersburg under the pseudonym \"Gerwazy Bomba\". During this time, he was friends with Henryk Rzewuski and J\u00f3zef Emanuel Przec\u0142awski, and was a member of the St. Petersburg Coterie, a group of Polish writers of aristocratic origin based in the Russian capital. At the end of his life he suffered from mental illness, and from 1880 onwards, he was completely insane.\n\nReferences\n\"Phrenophagos and Phrenolestes - Asymptote\". www.asymptotejournal.com.

His father held a clerkship in the war office in Berlin, and was pietistic and puritanical in his outlook and demands. Jacob Wittmer Hartmann speculates that Gutzkow's later agnosticism was probably a reaction against the excessive religiosity of his early surroundings. After completing his basic studies, beginning in 1829 Gutzkow studied theology and philosophy at the University of Berlin, where his teachers included Hegel and Schleiermacher.While still a student, he began his literary career by the publication in 1831 of a periodical entitled Forum der Journalliteratur. This brought him to the notice of Wolfgang Menzel, who invited him to Stuttgart to assist in the editorship of the Literaturblatt. At the same time he continued his university studies at Jena, Heidelberg and Munich. In 1832 he published Briefe eines Narren an eine N\u00e4rrin anonymously in Hamburg; and in 1833 his novel Maha-Guru, Geschichte eines Gottes, a fantastic and satirical romance set in Tibet, was issued in Stuttgart by the well known Cotta publishing house. In 1835 he went to Frankfurt, where he founded the Deutsche Revue. While Gutzkow started out as a collaborator of Wolfgang Menzel, he ended up his adversary.Also in 1835, his novel Wally die Zweiflerin appeared.  News of the 1830 July Revolution at Paris had moved him deeply, and the general atmosphere of radicalism pervading Europe at that time, and perhaps more specifically a reading of the Life of Jesus by David Friedrich Strauss, influenced Gutzkow in the composition of this first novel, which exalts the agnosticism and emancipated views of the heroine, Wally. The work was directed specially against the institution of marriage and the belief in revelation. The book incorporates many ideas that Gutzkow had recently absorbed from French writers, notably Henri de Saint-Simon, particularly the latter's theory of the emancipation of the flesh.Immediately after its publication, the writings of Gutzkow, together with those of Heinrich Heine, Heinrich Laube, Ludolf Wienbarg and Theodor Mundt, were banned by the German Federal Assembly in December 1835. This is usually taken as the starting point of the school known as Young Germany, literary reformers heralding the democratic upheaval of 1848. Whatever interest Gutzkow's novel might have attracted from its own merits was enhanced by the action of the German federal diet, which condemned Gutzkow to three months' imprisonment, decreed the suppression of all he had written or might yet write, and prohibited him from exercising the functions of editor within the German confederation.During his term of imprisonment at Mannheim, Gutzkow wrote his treatise Zur Philosophie der Geschichte (1836). On obtaining his freedom he returned to Frankfurt, whence he went in 1837 to Hamburg. Here he inaugurated a new epoch of his literary activity by bringing out his tragedy Richard Savage (1839), which immediately made the round of all the German theatres. Of his numerous other plays, the majority by c. 1910 were neglected; but a few had obtained an established place in the repertory of the German theatre, especially the comedies Zopf und Schwert (1844), Das Urbild des Tart\u00fcffe (1847), Der K\u00f6nigsleutnant (1849) and the blank verse tragedy, Uriel Acosta (1847). In 1847, Gutzkow went to Dresden, where he succeeded Tieck as literary adviser to the court theatre. Meanwhile, he had not neglected the novel. Seraphine (1838) was followed by Blasedow und seine S\u00f6hne, a satire on the educational theories of the time. Between 1850 and 1852 appeared Die Ritter vom Geiste, which may be regarded as the starting point for the modern German social novel. Der Zauberer von Rom is a powerful study of Roman Catholic life in southern Germany.\nAfter the success of Die Ritter vom Geiste, Gutzkow founded a journal on the model of Dickens' Household Words, entitled Unterhaltungen am h\u00e4uslichen Herd, which first appeared in 1852 and continued till 1862. In 1864 he had an epileptic fit, and his theatrical powers began to diminish. To this period belong the historical novels Hohenschwangau (1868) and Fritz Ellrodt (1872), Lebensbilder (1870\u20131872), consisting of autobiographic sketches, and Die S\u00f6hne Pestalozzis (1870), with a plot founded on the story of Kaspar Hauser. After another epileptic episode Gutzkow journeyed to Italy in 1873, taking up residence in the country near Heidelberg on his return before moving again to Frankfurt, where he died on 16 December 1878.With his play Uriel Acosta, and other works, Gutzkow stood up for the emancipation of the Jews; this play would later become the first classic play to be translated into Yiddish, and become a longtime standard of Yiddish theater. Gutzkow was never a revolutionary, and he became more conservative with age. He was one of the first Germans who tried to make a living by writing. His strong controversial purpose obscured his artistic genius, but his work profoundly influenced the popular thought of c. 1910 Germany, and gives one of the best pictures we have of the intellectual life and the social struggle of his generation and nation.\nAdaptations\nHis comedy in 5 acts Zopf und Schwert (1844) received two adaptations; in 1926 Aafa-Film made the movie Sword and Shield, and Edmund Nick used it for his operetta \u00dcber alles siegt die Liebe (Love Conquers Everything, 1940), libretto by Bruno Hardt-Warden.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"Works by Karl Gutzkow\".

He wrote critical texts on organized religion, Christendom, morality, ethics, psychology, and the philosophy of religion, displaying a fondness for metaphor, irony, and parables. Much of his philosophical work deals with the issues of how one lives as a \"single individual\", giving priority to concrete human reality over abstract thinking and highlighting the importance of personal choice and commitment. He was against literary critics who defined idealist intellectuals and philosophers of his time, and thought that Swedenborg, Hegel, Fichte, Schelling, Schlegel, and Hans Christian Andersen were all \"understood\" far too quickly by \"scholars\".Kierkegaard's theological work focuses on Christian ethics, the institution of the Church, the differences between purely objective proofs of Christianity, the infinite qualitative distinction between man and God, and the individual's subjective relationship to the God-Man Jesus the Christ, which came through faith. Much of his work deals with Christian love. He was extremely critical of the practice of Christianity as a state religion, primarily that of the Church of Denmark. His psychological work explored the emotions and feelings of individuals when faced with life choices.Kierkegaard's early work was written under the various pseudonyms to present distinctive viewpoints that interact in complex dialogue. He explored particularly complex problems from different viewpoints, each under a different pseudonym. He wrote many Upbuilding Discourses under his own name and dedicated them to the \"single individual\" who might want to discover the meaning of his works. Notably, he wrote: \"Science and scholarship want to teach that becoming objective is the way. Christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective, to become a subject.\" While scientists can learn about the world by observation, Kierkegaard emphatically denied that observation alone could reveal the inner workings of the world of the spirit.Some of Kierkegaard's key ideas include the concept of \"subjective and objective truths\", the knight of faith, the recollection and repetition dichotomy, angst, the infinite qualitative distinction, faith as a passion, and the three stages on life's way. Kierkegaard wrote in Danish and the reception of his work was initially limited to Scandinavia, but by the turn of the 20th century his writings were translated into French, German, and other major European languages. By the mid-20th century, his thought exerted a substantial influence on philosophy, theology, and Western culture.\nEarly years (1813\u20131836)\nKierkegaard was born to an affluent family in Copenhagen. His mother, Ane S\u00f8rensdatter Lund Kierkegaard, had served as a maid in the household before marrying his father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard. She was an unassuming figure: quiet, and not formally educated. Her granddaughter, Henriette Lund, wrote that she \"wielded the sceptre with joy and protected [S\u00f8ren and Peter] like a hen protecting her chicks\". She also wielded influence on her children so that later Peter said that his brother preserved many of their mother's words in his writings. His father, on the other hand, was a well-to-do wool merchant from Jutland. He was a \"very stern man, to all appearances dry and prosaic, but under his 'rustic cloak' demeanor he concealed an active imagination which not even his great age could blunt\". He was also interested in philosophy and often hosted intellectuals at his home. The young Kierkegaard read the philosophy of Christian Wolff. Kierkegaard, who followed his father's beliefs as a child, was heavily influenced by Michael's devotion to Wolffian rationalism, which caused his father to retire partly to pursue more of Wolff's writings. He also preferred the comedies of Ludvig Holberg, the writings of Johann Georg Hamann, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Edward Young, and Plato. The figure of Socrates, who Kierkegaard encountered in Plato's dialogues, would prove to be a phenomenal influence on the philosopher's later interest in irony, as well as his frequent deployment of indirect communication.\nCopenhagen in the 1830s and 1840s had crooked streets where carriages rarely went. Kierkegaard loved to walk them. In 1848, Kierkegaard wrote, \"I had real Christian satisfaction in the thought that, if there were no other, there was definitely one man in Copenhagen whom every poor person could freely accost and converse with on the street; that, if there were no other, there was one man who, whatever the society he most commonly frequented, did not shun contact with the poor, but greeted every maidservant he was acquainted with, every manservant, every common laborer.\" Our Lady's Church was at one end of the city, where Bishop Mynster preached the Gospel. At the other end was the Royal Theatre where Fru Heiberg performed.\nBased on a speculative interpretation of anecdotes in Kierkegaard's unpublished journals, especially a rough draft of a story called \"The Great Earthquake\", some early Kierkegaard scholars argued that Michael believed he had earned God's wrath and that none of his children would outlive him. He is said to have believed that his personal sins, perhaps indiscretions such as cursing the name of God in his youth or impregnating Ane out of wedlock, necessitated this punishment. Though five of his seven children died before he did, both Kierkegaard and his brother Peter Christian Kierkegaard outlived him. Peter, who was seven years Kierkegaard's elder, later became bishop in Aalborg. Julia Watkin thought Michael's early interest in the Moravian Church could have led him to a deep sense of the devastating effects of sin.Kierkegaard came to hope that no one would retain their sins even though they have been forgiven. And by the same token that no one who truly believed in the forgiveness of sin would live their own life as an objection against the existence of forgiveness. He made the point that Cato committed suicide before Caesar had a chance to forgive him. This fear of not finding forgiveness is devastating. Edna H. Hong quoted Kierkegaard in her 1984 book, Forgiveness is a Work As Well As a Grace and Kierkegaard wrote about forgiveness in 1847. In 1954, Samuel Barber set to music Kierkegaard's prayer, \"Father in Heaven! Hold not our sins up against us but hold us up against our sins so that the thought of You when it wakens in our soul, and each time it wakens, should not remind us of what we have committed but of what You did forgive, not of how we went astray but of how You did save us!\"\n\nFrom 1821 to 1830 Kierkegaard attended the School of Civic Virtue, \u00d8stre Borgerdyd Gymnasium when the school was situated in Klarebodeme, where he studied Latin and history among other subjects. During his time there he was described as \"very conservative\"; someone who would \"honour the King, love the church and respect the police\". He frequently got into altercations with fellow students and was ambivalent towards his teachers. He went on to study theology at the University of Copenhagen. He had little interest in historical works, philosophy dissatisfied him, and he couldn't see \"dedicating himself to Speculation\". He said, \"What I really need to do is to get clear about \"what am I to do\", not what I must know.\" He wanted to \"lead a completely human life and not merely one of knowledge\". Kierkegaard didn't want to be a philosopher in the traditional or Hegelian sense and he didn't want to preach a Christianity that was an illusion. \"But he had learned from his father that one can do what one wills, and his father's life had not discredited this theory.\"One of the first physical descriptions of Kierkegaard comes from an attendee, Hans Br\u00f8chner, at his brother Peter's wedding party in 1836: \"I found [his appearance] almost comical. He was then twenty-three years old; he had something quite irregular in his entire form and had a strange coiffure. His hair rose almost six inches above his forehead into a tousled crest that gave him a strange, bewildered look.\" Another comes from Kierkegaard's niece, Henriette Lund (1829\u20131909). When S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard was a little boy he \"was of slender and delicate appearance, and ran about in a little coat of red-cabbage color. He used to be called 'fork' by his father, because of his tendency, developed quite early, toward satirical remarks. Although a serious, almost austere tone pervaded the Kierkegaards' house, I have the firm impression that there was a place for youthful vivacity too, even though of a more sedate and home-made kind than one is used to nowadays. The house was open for an 'old-fashioned hospitality'\" he was also described \"quaintly attired, slight and small\".\nKierkegaard's mother \"was a nice little woman with an even and happy disposition,\" according to a grandchild's description. She was never mentioned in Kierkegaard's works. Ane died on 31 July 1834, age 66, possibly from typhus. His father died on 8 August 1838, age 82. On 11 August, Kierkegaard wrote: \"My father died on Wednesday (the 8th) at 2:00\u00a0a.m. I so deeply desired that he might have lived a few years more... Right now I feel there is only one person (E. Boesen) with whom I can really talk about him. He was a 'faithful friend.'\" Troels Frederik Lund, his nephew, was instrumental in providing biographers with much information regarding S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. Lund was a good friend of Georg Brandes and Julius Lange. Here is an anecdote about his father from Kierkegaard's journals. At lunch one day I overturned a salt-shaker. Passionate as he was and intense as he easily could become, he began to scold so severely that he even said that I was a prodigal and things like that. Then I made an objection, reminding him of an old episode in the family when my sister Nicoline had dropped a very expensive tureen and Father had not said a word but pretended it was nothing at all. He replied: Well, you see, it was such an expensive thing that no scolding was needed; she realized quite well that it was wrong, but precisely when it is a trifle there must be a scolding. Journals X3A78\nJournals\nAccording to Samuel Hugo Bergmann, \"Kierkegaard's journals are one of the most important sources for an understanding of his philosophy\". Kierkegaard wrote over 7,000 pages in his journals on events, musings, thoughts about his works and everyday remarks. The entire collection of Danish journals (Journalen) was edited and published in 13 volumes consisting of 25 separate bindings including indices. The first English edition of the journals was edited by Alexander Dru in 1938. The style is \"literary and poetic [in] manner\".Kierkegaard wanted to have Regine, his fianc\u00e9e (see below), as his confidant but considered it an impossibility for that to happen so he left it to \"my reader, that single individual\" to become his confidant. His question was whether or not one can have a spiritual confidant. He wrote the following in his Concluding Postscript: \"With regard to the essential truth, a direct relation between spirit and spirit is unthinkable. If such a relation is assumed, it actually means that the party has ceased to be spirit.\"Kierkegaard's journals were the source of many aphorisms credited to the philosopher. The following passage, from 1 August 1835, is perhaps his most oft-quoted aphorism and a key quote for existentialist studies:\n\n\"What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.\"\nHe wrote this way about indirect communication in the same journal entry.\n\nOne must first learn to know himself before knowing anything else (\u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd). Not until a man has inwardly understood himself and then sees the course he is to take does his life gain peace and meaning; only then is he free of that irksome, sinister traveling companion \u2013 that irony of life, which manifests itself in the sphere of knowledge and invites true knowing to begin with a not-knowing (Socrates) just as God created the world from nothing. But in the waters of morality it is especially at home to those who still have not entered the tradewinds of virtue. Here it tumbles a person about in a horrible way, for a time lets him feel happy and content in his resolve to go ahead along the right path, then hurls him into the abyss of despair. Often it lulls a man to sleep with the thought, \"After all, things cannot be otherwise,\" only to awaken him suddenly to a rigorous interrogation. Frequently it seems to let a veil of forgetfulness fall over the past, only to make every single trifle appear in a strong light again. When he struggles along the right path, rejoicing in having overcome temptation's power, there may come at almost the same time, right on the heels of perfect victory, an apparently insignificant external circumstance which pushes him down, like Sisyphus, from the height of the crag. Often when a person has concentrated on something, a minor external circumstance arises which destroys everything. (As in the case of a man who, weary of life, is about to throw himself into the Thames and at the crucial moment is halted by the sting of a mosquito.) Frequently a person feels his very best when the illness is the worst, as in tuberculosis. In vain he tries to resist it but he has not sufficient strength, and it is no help to him that he has gone through the same thing many times; the kind of practice acquired in this way does not apply here.\n(S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard's Journals & Papers IA Gilleleie, 1 August 1835)\nAlthough his journals clarify some aspects of his work and life, Kierkegaard took care not to reveal too much. Abrupt changes in thought, repetitive writing, and unusual turns of phrase are some among the many tactics he used to throw readers off track. Consequently, there are many varying interpretations of his journals. Kierkegaard did not doubt the importance his journals would have in the future. In December 1849, he wrote: \"Were I to die now the effect of my life would be exceptional; much of what I have simply jotted down carelessly in the Journals would become of great importance and have a great effect; for then people would have grown reconciled to me and would be able to grant me what was, and is, my right.\"\nRegine Olsen and graduation (1837\u20131841)\nAn important aspect of Kierkegaard's life \u2013 generally considered to have had a major influence on his work \u2013 was his broken engagement to Regine Olsen (1822\u20131904). Kierkegaard and Olsen met on 8 May 1837 and were instantly attracted to each other, but sometime around 11 August 1838 he had second thoughts. In his journals, Kierkegaard wrote idealistically about his love for her.On 8 September 1840, Kierkegaard formally proposed to Olsen. He soon felt disillusioned about his prospects. He broke off the engagement on 11 August 1841, though it is generally believed that the two were deeply in love. In his journals, Kierkegaard mentions his belief that his \"melancholy\" made him unsuitable for marriage, but his precise motive for ending the engagement remains unclear. Later on, he wrote: \"I owe everything to the wisdom of an old man and to the simplicity of a young girl.\" The old man in this statement is said to be his father while Olsen was the girl. Martin Buber said \"Kierkegaard does not marry in defiance of the whole nineteenth century\".\nKierkegaard then turned his attention to his examinations. On 13 May 1839, he wrote, \"I have no alternative than to suppose that it is God's will that I prepare for my examination and that it is more pleasing to Him that I do this than actually coming to some clearer perception by immersing myself in one or another sort of research, for obedience is more precious to him than the fat of rams.\" The death of his father and the death of Poul M\u00f8ller also played a part in his decision.\nOn 29 September 1841, Kierkegaard wrote and defended his master's thesis, On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates. The university panel considered it noteworthy and thoughtful, but too informal and witty for a serious academic thesis. The thesis dealt with irony and Schelling's 1841 lectures, which Kierkegaard had attended with Mikhail Bakunin, Jacob Burckhardt, and Friedrich Engels; each had come away with a different perspective. Kierkegaard graduated from university on 20 October 1841 with a Magister Artium (Master of Arts). His family's inheritance of approximately 31,000 rigsdaler enabled him to fund his work and living expenses including servants.\n\nAuthorship (1843\u20131846)\nKierkegaard published some of his works using pseudonyms and for others he signed his own name as author. Whether being published under pseudonym or not, Kierkegaard's central writing on religion was Fear and Trembling, and Either\/Or is considered to be his magnum opus. Pseudonyms were used often in the early 19th century as a means of representing viewpoints other than the author's own; examples include the writers of the Federalist Papers and the Anti-Federalist Papers.  Kierkegaard employed the same technique as a way to provide examples of indirect communication. In writing under various pseudonyms to express sometimes contradictory positions, Kierkegaard is sometimes criticized for playing with various viewpoints without ever committing to one in particular. He has been described by those opposing his writings as indeterminate in his standpoint as a writer, though he himself has testified to all his work deriving from a service to Christianity. After On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates, his 1841 master's thesis under Frederik Christian Sibbern, he wrote his first book under the pseudonym \"Johannes Climacus\" (after John Climacus) between 1841 and 1842. De omnibus dubitandum est (Latin: \"Everything must be doubted\") was not published until after his death.\nKierkegaard's magnum opus Either\/Or was published 20 February 1843; it was mostly written during Kierkegaard's stay in Berlin, where he took notes on Schelling's Philosophy of Revelation. Either\/Or includes essays of literary and music criticism and a set of romantic-like-aphorisms, as part of his larger theme of examining the reflective and philosophical structure of faith. Edited by \"Victor Eremita\", the book contained the papers of an unknown \n\"A\" and \"B\" which the pseudonymous author claimed to have discovered in a secret drawer of his secretary. Eremita had a hard time putting the papers of \"A\" in order because they were not straightforward. \"B\"'s papers were arranged in an orderly fashion. Both of these characters are trying to become religious individuals. Each approached the idea of first love from an esthetic and an ethical point of view. The book is basically an argument about faith and marriage with a short discourse at the end telling them they should stop arguing. Eremita thinks \"B\", a judge, makes the most sense. Kierkegaard stressed the \"how\" of Christianity as well as the \"how\" of book reading in his works rather than the \"what\".Three months after the publication of Either\/Or, 16 May 1843, he published Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 and continued to publish discourses along with his pseudonymous books. These discourses were published under Kierkegaard's own name and are available as Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses today. David F. Swenson first translated the works in the 1940s and titled them the Edifying Discourses; however, in 1990, Howard V. and Edna H. Hong translated the works again but called them the Upbuilding Discourses. The word \"upbuilding\" was more in line with Kierkegaard's thought after 1846, when he wrote Christian deliberations about Works of Love. An upbuilding discourse or edifying discourse isn't the same as a sermon because a sermon is preached to a congregation while a discourse can be carried on between several people or even with oneself. The discourse or conversation should be \"upbuilding\", which means one would build up the other person, or oneself, rather than tear down to build up. Kierkegaard said: \"Although this little book (which is called \"discourses,\" not sermons, because its author does not have authority to preach, \"upbuilding discourses,\" not discourses for upbuilding, because the speaker by no means claims to be a teacher) wishes to be only what it is, a superfluity, and desires only to remain in hiding\".On 16 October 1843, Kierkegaard published three more books about love and faith and several more discourses. Fear and Trembling was published under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio. Repetition is about a Young Man (S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard) who has anxiety and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love for a girl (Regine Olsen) to God. He tries to see if the new science of psychology can help him understand himself. Constantin Constantius, who is the pseudonymous author of that book, is the psychologist. At the same time, he published Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 under his own name, which dealt specifically with how love can be used to hide things from yourself or others. These three books, all published on the same day, are an example of Kierkegaard's method of indirect communication.\nKierkegaard questioned whether an individual can know if something is a good gift from God or not and concludes by saying, \"it does not depend, then, merely upon what one sees, but what one sees depends upon how one sees; all observation is not just a receiving, a discovering, but also a bringing forth, and insofar as it is that, how the observer himself is constituted is indeed decisive.\" God's love is imparted indirectly just as our own sometimes is.During 1844, he published two, three, and four more upbuilding discourses just as he did in 1843, but here he discussed how an individual might come to know God. Theologians, philosophers and historians were all engaged in debating about the existence of God. This is direct communication and Kierkegaard thinks this might be useful for theologians, philosophers, and historians (associations) but not at all useful for the \"single individual\" who is interested in becoming a Christian. Kierkegaard always wrote for \"that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader\" The single individual must put what is understood to use or it will be lost. Reflection can take an individual only so far before the imagination begins to change the whole content of what was being thought about. Love is won by being exercised just as much as faith and patience are.\nHe also wrote several more pseudonymous books in 1844: Philosophical Fragments, Prefaces and The Concept of Anxiety and finished the year up with Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. He used indirect communication in the first book and direct communication in the rest of them. He doesn't believe the question about God's existence should be an opinion held by one group and differently by another no matter how many demonstrations are made. He says it's up to the single individual to make the fruit of the Holy Spirit real because love and joy are always just possibilities. Christendom wanted to define God's attributes once and for all but Kierkegaard was against this. His love for Regine was a disaster but it helped him because of his point of view.\nKierkegaard believed \"each generation has its own task and need not trouble itself unduly by being everything to previous and succeeding generations\". In an earlier book he had said, \"to a certain degree every generation and every individual begins his life from the beginning\", and in another, \"no generation has learned to love from another, no generation is able to begin at any other point than the beginning\", \"no generation learns the essentially human from a previous one.\" And, finally, in 1850 he wrote, \"those true Christians who in every generation live a life contemporaneous with that of Christ have nothing whatsoever to do with Christians of the preceding generation, but all the more with their contemporary, Christ. His life here on earth attends every generation, and every generation severally, as Sacred History...\" He was against the Hegelian idea of mediation because it introduces a \"third term\" that comes between the single individual and the object of desire. Kierkegaard wrote in 1844, 'If a person can be assured of the grace of God without needing temporal evidence as a middleman or as the dispensation advantageous to him as interpreter, then it is indeed obvious to him that the grace of God is the most glorious of all.\" He was against mediation and settled instead on the choice to be content with the grace of God or not. It's the choice between the possibility of the \"temporal and the eternal\", \"mistrust and belief, and deception and truth\", \"subjective and objective\". These are the \"magnitudes\" of choice. He always stressed deliberation and choice in his writings and wrote against comparison. This is how Kant put it in 1786 and Kierkegaard put it in 1847: Thinking for one's self is to seek the chief touchstone of truth in one's self (id est, in one's own reason); and the maxim, to think for one's self at all times is Enlightening. Thereto belongs not just so much, as those may imagine who take knowledge, to be enlightening; as it is rather a negative principle in the use of one's cognoscitive faculty, and he, who is very rich in knowledge, is often the least enlightened in the use of it. To exercise one's own reason, means nothing more, than, relatively to every thing which one is to suppose, to question one's self.\nWorldly worry always seeks to lead a human being into the small-minded unrest of comparisons, away from the lofty calmness of simple thoughts. To be clothed, then, means to be a human being-and therefore to be well clothed. Worldly worry is preoccupied with clothes and dissimilarity of clothes.  Should not the invitation to learn from the lilies be welcome to everyone just as the reminder is useful to him! Alas, those great, uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts, are more and more forgotten, perhaps entirely forgotten in the weekday and worldly life of comparisons. The one human being compares himself with others, the one generation compares itself with the other, and thus the heaped up pile of comparisons overwhelms a person. As the ingenuity and busyness increase, there come to be more and more in each generation who slavishly work a whole lifetime far down in the low underground regions of comparisons. Indeed, just as miners never see the light of day, so these unhappy people never come to see the light: those uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts about how glorious it is to be a human being. And up there in the higher regions of comparison, smiling vanity plays its false game and deceives the happy ones so that they receive no impression from those lofty, simple thoughts, those first thoughts.\nThe inwardness of faith\nKierkegaard believed God comes to each individual mysteriously. Kierkegaard published Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions (first called Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life, in David F. Swenson's 1941 translation) under his own name on 29 April, and Stages on Life's Way edited by Hilarius Bookbinder, 30 April 1845. The Stages is a sequel to Either\/Or which Kierkegaard did not think had been adequately read by the public and in Stages he predicted \"that two-thirds of the book's readers will quit before they are halfway through, out of boredom they will throw the book away.\" He knew he was writing books but had no idea who was reading them. His sales were meager and he had no publicist or editor. He was writing in the dark, so to speak.\nHe then went to Berlin for a short rest. Upon returning he published his Discourses of 1843\u201344 in one volume, Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, 29 May 1845 and finished the first part of his authorship with Concluding Unscientific Postscript to the Philosophical Fragments which is a sequel to Philosophical Fragments as well as an explanation of the first part of his authorship. In 1851 he further explained himself in his Journal. \"What I have understood as the task of the authorship has been done. It is one idea, this continuity from Either\/Or to Anti-Climacus, the idea of religiousness in reflection. The task has occupied me totally, for it has occupied me religiously; I have understood the completion of this authorship as my duty, as a responsibility resting upon me.\" He advised his reader to read his books slowly and also to read them aloud since that might aid in understanding. Kierkegaard identified this leap of faith as the good resolution. Kierkegaard discussed the knight of faith like this in Works of Love, 1847.   Consider the woman with hemorrhages; she did not press herself forward to touch Christ's robe; she told no one what she had in mind and what she believed-she said very softly to herself, \"If I only touch the hem of his robe, I shall be healed\". The secret she kept to herself; it was the secret of faith that saved her both temporally and eternally. You can keep the secret to yourself also when you profess your faith with bold confidence, and when you lie weak on your sickbed and cannot move a limb when you cannot even move your tongue, you can still have the secret within you. But the originality of faith is related in turn to the originality of Christianity. Works of Love, 1847, Hong 1995 p. 28-29\nHe was writing about the subjective, inward nature of God's encounter with the individual in many of these books, and his goal was to get the single individual away from all the speculation that was going on about God and Christ. Speculation creates quantities of ways to find God and his Goods but finding faith in Christ and putting the understanding to use stops all speculation because then one begins to actually exist as a Christian or in an ethical\/religious way. He was against an individual waiting until certain of God's love and salvation before beginning to try to become a Christian. He defined this as a \"special type of religious conflict the Germans call Anfechtung\" (contesting or disputing). In Kierkegaard's view the Church should not try to prove Christianity or even defend it. It should help the single individual to make a leap of faith, the faith that God is love and has a task for that very same single individual. He wrote the following about fear and trembling and love as early as 1839, \"Fear and trembling is not the primus motor in the Christian life, for it is love; but it is what the oscillating balance wheel is to the clock-it is the oscillating balance wheel of the Christian life.When we take a religious person, the knight of hidden inwardness, and place him in the existence-medium, a contradiction will appear as he relates himself to the world around him, and he himself must become aware of this. The contradiction does not consist in his being different from everyone else but the contradiction is that he, with all his inwardness hidden within him, with this pregnancy of suffering and benediction in his inner being, looks just like all the others-and inwardness is indeed hidden simply by his looking exactly like others. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 499\"What blessed equality, that in the strictest sense the sufferer can unconditionally do the highest as fully as well as the most gifted person in the most fortunate sense. Honor and praise be to the eternal: there is not a shade of difference, there is no wrongdoing and no preferential treatment, but equality. You are indistinguishable from anyone else among those whom you might wish to resemble, those who in the decision are with the good-they are all clothed alike, girdled about the loins with truth, clad in the armor of righteousness, wearing the helmet of salvation!\"  S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 111If doubt is the beginning, then God is lost long before the end, and the individual is released from always having a task, but also from always having the comfort that there is always a task. But if the consciousness of guilt is the beginning, then the beginning of doubt is rendered impossible, and then the joy is that there is always a task. The joy, then, is that it is eternally certain that God is love; more specifically understood, the joy is that there is always a task. As long as there is life there is hope, but as long as there is a task there is life, and as long as there is life there is hope-indeed, the task itself is not merely a hope for a future time but is a joyful present. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 279-280, 277How much that is hidden may still reside in a person, or how much may still reside hidden! How inventive is hidden inwardness in hiding itself and in deceiving or evading others, the hidden inwardness that preferred that no one would suspect its existence, modestly afraid of being seen and mortally afraid of being entirely disclosed! Is it not so that the one person never completely understands the other? But if he does not understand him completely, then of course it is always possible that the most indisputable thing could still have a completely different explanation that would, note well, be the true explanation, since an assumption can indeed explain a great number of instances very well and thereby confirm its truth and yet show itself to be untrue as soon as the instance comes along that it cannot explain-and it would indeed be possible that this instance or this somewhat more precise specification could come even at the last moment. Therefore all calm and, in the intellectual sense, dispassionate observers, who eminently know how to delve searchingly and penetratingly into the inner being, these very people judge with such infinite caution or refrain from it entirely because, enriched by observation, they have a developed conception of the enigmatic world of the hidden, and because as observers they have learned to rule over their passions. Only superficial, impetuous passionate people, who do not understand themselves and for that reason naturally are unaware that they do not know others, judge precipitously. Those with insight, those who know never do this. Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, (1847) Hong 1995 p. 228-229\nThis poetical venture is entirely correct and perhaps can, among other things, serve to shed light on a fraud or a misunderstanding that has appeared repeatedly in all Christendom. A person makes Christian humility and self-denial empty when he indeed denies himself in one respect but does not have the courage to do it decisively, and therefore he takes care to be understood in his humility and self-denial \u2013 which certainly is not self-denial. Therefore, to be able to praise love, self-denial is required inwardly and self-sacrificing outwardly. If, then, someone undertakes to praise love and is asked whether it is actually out of love on his part that he does it, the answer must be: \"No one else can decide this for certain; it is possible that it is vanity, pride-in short, something bad, but it is also possible that it is love.\"  Soren Kierkegaard, 1847, Works of Love, Hong 1995 p. 374\n\nKierkegaard wrote his Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments in 1846 and here he tried to explain the intent of the first part of his authorship. He said, \"Christianity will not be content to be an evolution within the total category of human nature; an engagement such as that is too little to offer to a god. Neither does it even want to be the paradox for the believer, and then surreptitiously, little by little, provide him with understanding, because the martyrdom of faith (to crucify one's understanding) is not a martyrdom of the moment, but the martyrdom of continuance.\" The second part of his authorship was summed up in Practice in Christianity: The deification of the established order is the secularization of everything. With regard to secular matters, the established order may be entirely right: one should join the established order, be satisfied with that relativity, etc. But ultimately the relationship with God is also secularized; we want it to coincide with a certain relativity, do not want it to be something essentially different from our positions in life \u2013 rather than that it shall be the absolute for every individual human being and this, the individual person\u2019s God-relationship, shall be precisely what keeps every established order in suspense, and that God, at any moment he chooses, if he merely presses upon an individual in his relationship with God, promptly has a witness, an informer, a spy, or whatever you want to call it, one who in unconditional obedience and with unconditional obedience, by being persecuted, by suffering, by dying, keeps the established order in suspense. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Practice in Christianity (1850) p. 91 Hong\nEarly Kierkegaardian scholars, such as Theodor W. Adorno and Thomas Henry Croxall, argue that the entire authorship should be treated as Kierkegaard's own personal and religious views. This view leads to confusions and contradictions which make Kierkegaard appear philosophically incoherent. Later scholars, such as the post-structuralists, interpreted Kierkegaard's work by attributing the pseudonymous texts to their respective authors. Postmodern Christians present a different interpretation of Kierkegaard's works. Kierkegaard used the category of \"The Individual\" to stop the endless Either\/Or.\nPseudonyms\nKierkegaard's most important pseudonyms, in chronological order, were:\n\nVictor Eremita, editor of Either\/Or\nA, writer of many articles in Either\/Or\nJudge William, author of rebuttals to A in Either\/Or\nJohannes de Silentio, author of Fear and Trembling\nConstantine Constantius, author of the first half of Repetition\nYoung Man, author of the second half of Repetition\nVigilius Haufniensis, author of The Concept of Anxiety\nNicolaus Notabene, author of Prefaces\nHilarius Bookbinder, editor of Stages on Life's Way\nJohannes Climacus, author of Philosophical Fragments and Concluding Unscientific Postscript\nInter et Inter, author of The Crisis and a Crisis in the Life of an Actress\nH.H., author of Two Minor Ethical-Religious Essays\nAnti-Climacus, author of The Sickness Unto Death and Practice in Christianity\nKierkegaard explained his pseudonyms this way in his Concluding Unscientific Postscript: In Either\/Or, I am just as little, precisely just as little, the editor Victor Eremita as I am the Seducer or the Judge. He is a poetically actual subjective thinker who is found again in \"In Vino Veritas\". In Fear and Trembling, I am just as little, precisely just as little, Johannes de Silentio as the knight of faith he depicts, and in turn just as little the author of the preface to the book, which is the individuality-lines of a poetically actual subjective thinker. In the story of suffering (\"'Guilty?\/'Not Guilty'\"), I am just as remote from being Quidam of the imaginary construction as from being the imaginative constructor, just as remote, since the imaginative constructor is a poetically actual subjective thinker and what is imaginatively constructed is his psychologically consistent production. Soren Kierkegaard, Concluding Postscript 1846, Hong p. 625-626\nAll of these writings analyze the concept of faith, on the supposition that if people are confused about faith, as Kierkegaard thought the inhabitants of Christendom were, they will not be in a position to develop the virtue. Faith is a matter of reflection in the sense that one cannot have the virtue unless one has the concept of virtue \u2013 or at any rate the concepts that govern faith's understanding of self, world, and God.\nThe Corsair Affair\nOn 22 December 1845, Peder Ludvig M\u00f8ller, who studied at the University of Copenhagen at the same time as Kierkegaard, published an article indirectly criticizing Stages on Life's Way. The article complimented Kierkegaard for his wit and intellect, but questioned whether he would ever be able to master his talent and write coherent, complete works. M\u00f8ller was also a contributor to and editor of The Corsair, a Danish satirical paper that lampooned everyone of notable standing. Kierkegaard published a sarcastic response, charging that M\u00f8ller's article was merely an attempt to impress Copenhagen's literary elite.\nKierkegaard wrote two small pieces in response to M\u00f8ller, The Activity of a Traveling Esthetician and Dialectical Result of a Literary Police Action. The former focused on insulting M\u00f8ller's integrity while the latter was a directed assault on The Corsair, in which Kierkegaard, after criticizing the journalistic quality and reputation of the paper, openly asked The Corsair to satirize him.Kierkegaard's response earned him the ire of the paper and its second editor, also an intellectual of Kierkegaard's own age, Me\u00efr Aron Goldschmidt. Over the next few months, The Corsair took Kierkegaard up on his offer to \"be abused\", and unleashed a series of attacks making fun of Kierkegaard's appearance, voice and habits. For months, Kierkegaard perceived himself to be the victim of harassment on the streets of Denmark. In a journal entry dated 9 March 1846, Kierkegaard made a long, detailed explanation of his attack on M\u00f8ller and The Corsair, and also explained that this attack made him rethink his strategy of indirect communication.\nThere had been much discussion in Denmark about the pseudonymous authors until the publication of Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, 27 February 1846, where he openly admitted to be the author of the books because people began wondering if he was, in fact, a Christian or not. Several Journal entries from that year shed some light on what Kierkegaard hoped to achieve. This book was published under an earlier pseudonym, Johannes Climacus. On 30 March 1846 he published Two Ages: A Literary Review, under his own name. A critique of the novel Two Ages (in some translations Two Generations) written by Thomasine Christine Gyllembourg-Ehrensv\u00e4rd, Kierkegaard made several insightful observations on what he considered the nature of modernity and its passionless attitude towards life. Kierkegaard writes that \"the present age is essentially a sensible age, devoid of passion ... The trend today is in the direction of mathematical equality, so that in all classes about so and so many uniformly make one individual\". In this, Kierkegaard attacked the conformity and assimilation of individuals into \"the crowd\" which became the standard for truth, since it was the numerical. How can one love the neighbor if the neighbor is always regarded as the wealthy or the poor or the lame?  A useless and perhaps futile conflict goes on often enough in the world, when the poor person says to the wealthy person, \"Sure, it's easy for you \u2013 you are free from worry about making a living.\" Would to God that the poor person would really understand how the Gospel is much more kindly disposed to him, is treating him equally and more lovingly. Truly, the Gospel does not let itself be deceived into taking sides with anyone against someone else, with someone who is wealthy against someone who is poor, or with someone who is poor against someone who is wealthy. Among individuals in the world, the conflict of disconnected comparison is frequently carried on about dependence and independence, about the happiness of being independent and the difficulty of being dependent. And yet, yet human language has not ever, and thought has not ever, invented a more beautiful symbol of independence than the poor bird of the air. And yet, yet no speech can be more curious than to say that it must be very bad and very heavy to be \u2013 light as the bird! To be dependent on one's treasure \u2013 that is dependence and hard and heavy slavery; to be dependent on God, completely dependent \u2013 that is independence.  S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, 1847 Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 180-181\nAs part of his analysis of the \"crowd\", Kierkegaard accused newspapers of decay and decadence. Kierkegaard stated Christendom had \"lost its way\" by recognizing \"the crowd\", as the many who are moved by newspaper stories, as the court of last resort in relation to \"the truth\". Truth comes to a single individual, not all people at one and the same time. Just as truth comes to one individual at a time so does love. One doesn't love the crowd but does love their neighbor, who is a single individual. He says, \"never have I read in the Holy Scriptures this command: You shall love the crowd; even less: You shall, ethico-religiously, recognize in the crowd the court of last resort in relation to 'the truth.'\"\nAuthorship (1847\u20131855)\n\nKierkegaard began to write again in 1847: the three-part Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits. It included Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing, What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and from the Birds in the Air, and The Gospel of Sufferings. He asked, What does it mean to be a single individual who wants to do the good? What does it mean to be a human being? What does it mean to follow Christ? He now moves from \"upbuilding (Edifying) discourses\" to \"Christian discourses\", however, he still maintains that these are not \"sermons\". A sermon is about struggle with oneself about the tasks life offers one and about repentance for not completing the tasks. Later, in 1849, he wrote devotional discourses and Godly discourses.Is it really hopelessness to reject the task because it is too heavy; is it really hopelessness almost to collapse under the burden because it is so heavy; is it really hopelessness to give up hope out of fear of the task? Oh no, but this is hopelessness: to will with all one's might-but there is no task. Thus, only if there is nothing to do and if the person who says it were without guilt before God-for if he is guilty, there is indeed always something to do-only if there is nothing to do and this is understood to mean that there is no task, only then is there hopelessness. Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 277\nWhile the Savior of the world sighs, \"My God, my God, why have you abandoned me,\" the repentant robber humbly understands, but still also as a relief, that it is not God who has abandoned him, but it is he who has abandoned God, and, repenting, he says to the one crucified with him: Remember me when you come into your kingdom. It is a heavy human suffering to reach for God's mercy in the anxiety of death and with belated repentance at the moment of despicable death, but yet the repentant robber finds relief when he compares his suffering with the superhuman suffering of being abandoned by God. To be abandoned by God, that indeed means to be without a task. It means to be deprived of the final task that every human being always has, the task of patience, the task that has its ground in God's not having abandoned the sufferer. Hence Christ's suffering is superhuman and his patience superhuman, so that no human being can grasp either the one or the other. Although it is beneficial that we speak quite humanly of Christ's suffering, if we speak of it merely as if he were the human being who has suffered the most, it is blasphemy, because although his suffering is human, it is also superhuman, and there is an eternal chasmic abyss between his suffering and the human being's.  S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, 1847 Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p.280\nWorks of Love followed these discourses on (29 September 1847). Both books were authored under his own name. It was written under the themes \"Love covers a multitude of sins\" and \"Love builds up\". (1 Peter 4:8 and 1 Corinthians 8:1) Kierkegaard believed that \"all human speech, even divine speech of Holy Scripture, about the spiritual is essentially metaphorical speech\". \"To build up\" is a metaphorical expression. One can never be all human or all spirit, one must be both. \nWhen it is said, \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself,\" this contains what is presupposed, that every person loves himself. Thus, Christianity which by no means begins, as do those high flying thinkers, without presuppositions, nor with a flattering presupposition, presupposes this. Dare we then deny that it is as Christianity presupposes? But on the other hand, it is possible for anyone to misunderstand Christianity, as if it were its intention to teach what worldly sagacity unanimously-alas, and yet contentiously-teaches, \"that everyone is closest to himself.\" Is it possible for anyone to misunderstand this, as if it were Christianity's intention to proclaim self-love as a prescriptive right? Indeed on the contrary, it is Christianity's intention to wrest self-love away from us human beings. Soren Kierkegaard Works of Love, Hong p. 17\nAll human speech, even the divine speech of Holy Scripture, about the spiritual is essentially metaphorical [overfot, carried over] speech. And this is quite in order or in the order of things and of existence, since a human being, even if from the moment of birth his is a spirit, still does not become conscious of himself as a spirit until later and thus has sensately-psychically acted out a certain part of his life prior to this. But this first portion is not to be cast aside when the spirit awakens any more than the awakening of the spirit in contrast to the sensate-physical announces itself in a sensate-physical way. On the contrary, the first portion is taken over \u2013[overtage] by the spirit and, used in this way, is thus made the basis \u2013it becomes the metaphorical. Therefore, the spiritual person and the sensate person say the same thing; yet there is an infinite difference, since the latter has no intimation of the secret of the metaphorical words although he is using the same words, but not in their metaphorical sense.\nThere is a world of difference between the two; the one has made the transition or let himself be carried over to the other side, while the other remains on this side; yet they have the connection that both are using the same words. The person in whom the spirit has awakened does not as a consequence abandon the visible-world. Although conscious of himself as spirit, he continues to remain in the visible world and to be visible to the senses, in the same way he also remains in the language, except that his language is the metaphorical language!\nBut the metaphorical words are of course not brand-new words but are the already given words. Just as the spirit is invisible, so also is its language a secret, and the secret lies in its using the same words as the child and the simpleminded person but using them metaphorically, whereby the spirit denies the sensate or sensate-physical way. The difference is by no means a noticeable difference. For this reason we rightfully regard it as a sign of false spirituality to parade a noticeable difference-which is merely sensate, whereas the spirit's manner is the metaphor's quiet, whispering secret \u2013 for the person who has ears to hear. Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, 1847, Hong 1995 p. 209-210\n\nLove builds up by presupposing that love is present. Have you not experienced this yourself, my listener? If anyone has ever spoken to you in such a way or treated you in such a way that you really felt built up, this was because you very vividly perceived how he presupposed love to be in you. Wisdom is a being-for-itself quality; power, talent, knowledge, etc. are likewise being-for-itself qualities. To be wise does not mean to presuppose that others are wise; on the contrary, it may be very wise and true if the truly wise person assumes that far from all people are wise. But love is not a being-for-itself quality but a quality by which or in which you are for others. Loving means to presuppose love in others. Soren Kierkegaard Works of Love, Hong p. 222-224\nLater, in the same book, Kierkegaard deals with the question of sin and forgiveness. He uses the same text he used earlier in Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 Love hides a multitude of sins. (1 Peter 4:8). He asks if \"one who tells his neighbors faults hides or increases the multitude of sins\". But the one who takes away the consciousness of sin and gives the consciousness of forgiveness instead-he indeed takes away the heavy burden and gives the light one in its place. Soren Kierkegaard, 1847 Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 246\nThe one who loves sees the sin he forgives, but he believes that forgiveness takes it away. This cannot be seen, whereas the sin can indeed be seen; on the other hand, if the sin did not exist to be seen, it could not be forgiven either. Just as one by faith believes the unseen into what is seen, so the one who loves by forgiveness believes away what is seen. Both are faith. Blessed is the believer, he believes what he cannot see; blessed is the one who loves, he believes away that which he indeed can see! Who can believe this? The one who loves can do it. But why is forgiveness so rare? Is it not because faith in the power of forgiveness is so meager and so rare? Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, 1847 Hong p. 289-295\n\nIn 1848 he published Christian Discourses under his own name and The Crisis and a Crisis in the Life of an Actress under the pseudonym Inter et Inter. Christian Discourses deals the same theme as The Concept of Anxiety, angst. The text is the Gospel of Matthew 6 verses 24\u201334. This was the same passage he had used in his What We Learn From the Lilies in the Field and From the Birds of the Air of 1847. He wrote: A man who but rarely, and then only cursorily, concerns himself with his relationship to God, hardly thinks or dreams that he has so closely to do with God, or that God is so close to him, that there exists a reciprocal relationship between him and God, the stronger a man is, the weaker God is, the weaker a man is, the stronger God is in him. Every one who assumes that a God exists naturally thinks of Him as the strongest, as He eternally is, being the Almighty who creates out of nothing, and for whom all the creation is as nothing; but such a man hardly thinks of the possibility of a reciprocal relationship. And yet for God, the infinitely strongest, there is an obstacle; He has posited it Himself, yea, He has lovingly, with incomprehensible love posited it Himself; for He posited it and posits it every time a man comes into existence, when He in His love makes to be something directly in apposition to Himself. Oh, marvelous omnipotence of love! A man cannot bear that his 'creations' should be directly in apposition to Himself, and so he speaks of them in a tone of disparagement as his 'creations'. But God who creates out of nothing, who almightily takes from nothing and says, 'Be', lovingly adjoins, 'Be something even in apposition to me.' Marvellous love, even His omnipotence is under the sway of love! Soren Kierkegaard, Christian Discourses, 1848 Lowrie 1940, 1961 p. 132It is actually true that Christianity requires the Christian to give up and forsake all things. This was not required in Old Testament times, God did not require Job to give up anything, and of Abraham he required expressly, as a test, only that he give up Isaac. But in fact Christianity is also the religion of freedom, it is precisely the voluntary which is the Christian. Voluntarily to give up all is to be convinced of the glory of the good which Christianity promises. There is one thing God cannot take away from a man, namely, the voluntary \u2013 and it is precisely this which Christianity requires of man. Thoughts Which Wound From Behind \u2013 For Edification 1848 p. 187-188 (From Christian Discourses Translated by Walter Lowrie 1940, 1961)\nKierkegaard tried to explain his prolific use of pseudonyms again in The Point of View of My Work as an Author, his autobiographical explanation for his writing style. The book was finished in 1848, but not published until after his death by his brother Christian Peter Kierkegaard.  Walter Lowrie mentioned Kierkegaard's \"profound religious experience of Holy Week 1848\" as a turning point from \"indirect communication\" to \"direct communication\" regarding Christianity. However, Kierkegaard stated that he was a religious author throughout all of his writings and that his aim was to discuss \"the problem 'of becoming a Christian', with a direct polemic against the monstrous illusion we call Christendom\". He expressed the illusion this way in his 1848 \"Christian Address\", Thoughts Which Wound From Behind \u2013 for Edification. Oh, in the customary course of life there is so much to lull a man to sleep, to teach him to say, \u2018Peace and no danger.\u2019 It is for this cause we go into the house of God, to be awakened out of sleep and to be riven away from the enchantments. But then again when there is so much in the house of God to lull us! Even that which in itself is arousing, such as thoughts, reflections, ideas, can by custom and monotony lose all their significance, just as a spring can lose the resilience which makes it what it is. So, then (to approach nearer to the subject of this discourse), it is right, reasonable, and a plain duty, to invite men, over and over again, to come to the house of the Lord, to summon them to it. But one may become so accustomed to hearing this invitation that one may lose all sense of its significance, so that at last one steps away and it ends with the invitation preaching the church empty. Or one may become so accustomed to hearing this invitation that it develops false ideas in those that come, makes us self-important in our own thoughts, that we are not as they who remain away, makes us self-satisfied, secure, because it envelops us in a delusion, as though, since we are so urgently invited, God were in need of us, as though it were not we who in fear and trembling should reflect what He may require of us, as though it were not we who should sincerely thank God that He will have dealings with us, that He will suffer and permit us to approach Him, suffer that we presume to believe that He cares for us, that without being ashamed He will be known as one who is called our God and our Father. So concerning this matter let us for once talk differently, in talking of these words of the preacher: Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of the Lord. (Ecclesiastes 5:1) Soren Kierkegaard, Thoughts Which Wound From Behind \u2013 for Edification, Christian Address, Copenhagen 1848, Lowrie translation1961  p. 173 -174\nHe wrote three discourses under his own name and one pseudonymous book in 1849. He wrote The Lily in the Field and the Bird of the Air. Three Devotional Discourses, Three Discourses at the Communion on Fridays and Two Ethical-Religious Essays. The first thing any child finds in life is the external world of nature. This is where God placed his natural teachers. He's been writing about confession and now openly writes about Holy Communion which is generally preceded by confession. This he began with the confessions of the esthete and the ethicist in Either\/Or and the highest good peace in the discourse of that same book. His goal has always been to help people become religious but specifically Christian religious. He summed his position up earlier in his book, The Point of View of My Work as an Author, but this book was not published until 1859. In the month of December 1845 the manuscript of the Concluding Postscript was completely finished, and, as my custom was, I had delivered the whole of it at once to Lune [the printer]-which the suspicious do not have to believe on my word, since Luno's account-book is there to prove it. This work constitutes the turning-point in my whole activity as an author, inasmuch as it presents the 'problem', how to become a Christian.\nIn a Christian sense simplicity is not the point of departure from which one goes on to become interesting, witty, profound, poet, philosopher, &c. No, the very contrary. Here is where one begins (with the interesting, &c.) and becomes simpler and simpler, attaining simplicity. This, in 'Christendom' is the Christian movement: one does not reflect oneself into Christianity; but one reflects oneself out of something else and becomes, more and more simply, a Christian.\n\nI have never fought in such a way as to say: I am the true Christian, others are not Christians. No, my contention has been this: I know what Christianity is, my imperfection as a Christian I myself fully recognize\u2014but I know what Christianity is. And to get this properly recognized must be, I should think, to every man's interest, whether he be a Christian or not, whether his intention is to accept Christianity or to reject it. But I have attacked no one as not being a Christian, I have condemned no one. And I myself have from the first clearly asserted, again and again repeated, that I am 'without authority'. Soren Kierkegaard, The Point of View of My Work as an Author Lowrie, 53, 144, 153\u2013155\n\nThe Second edition of Either\/Or was published early in 1849. Later that year he published The Sickness Unto Death, under the pseudonym Anti-Climacus. He's against Johannes Climacus who kept writing books about trying to understand Christianity. Here he says, \"Let others admire and praise the person who pretends to comprehend Christianity. I regard it as a plain ethical task \u2013 perhaps requiring not a little self-denial in these speculative times, when all 'the others' are busy with comprehending-to admit that one is neither able nor supposed to comprehend it.\" Sickness unto death was a familiar phrase in Kierkegaard's earlier writings. This sickness is despair and for Kierkegaard despair is a sin. Despair is the impossibility of possibility. Kierkegaard writes: When a person who has been addicted to some sin or other but over a considerable period has now successfully resisted the temptation-when this person has a relapse and succumbs again to the temptation, then the depression that ensues is by no means always sorrow over the sin. It can be something quite different; it might also, for that matter, be resentment of divine governance, as if it were the latter that had let him fall into temptation and should not have been so hard on him, seeing that until now he had for so long successfully resisted the temptation. Such a person protests, perhaps in even stronger terms, how this relapse tortures and torments him, how it brings him to despair: he swears, 'I will never forgive myself.' He never forgives himself-but suppose God would forgive him; then he might well have the goodness to forgive himself. The Sickness Unto Death, by Anti-Climacus, Edited by Soren Kierkegaard, Copyright 1849 Translation with an Introduction and notes by Alastair Hannay 1989 p. 144\nIn Practice in Christianity, 25 September 1850, his last pseudonymous work, he stated, \"In this book, originating in the year 1848, the requirement for being a Christian is forced up by the pseudonymous authors to a supreme ideality.\" This work was called Training in Christianity when Walter Lowrie translated it in 1941. Christ is the truth in the sense that to be the truth is the only true explanation of what truth is. Therefore one can ask an apostle, one can ask a Christian, \"What is truth?\" and in answer to the question the apostle and the Christian will point to Christ and say: Look at him, learn from him, he was the truth. This means that truth in the sense in which Christ is the truth is not a sum of statements, not a definition etc., but a life. The being of truth is not the direct redoubling of being in relation to thinking, which gives only thought-being, safeguards thinking only against being a brain-figment that is not, guarantees validity to thinking, that what is thought is-that is, has validity. No, the being of truth is the redoubling of truth within yourself, within me, within him, that your life, my life, his life is approximately the being of the truth in the striving for it, just as the truth was in Christ a life, for he was the truth. And therefore, Christianly understood, truth is obviously not to know the truth but to be the truth. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Practice in Christianity, Hong p. 205 (1850)\nHe now pointedly referred to the acting single individual in his next three publications; For Self-Examination, Two Discourses at the Communion on Fridays, and in 1852 Judge for Yourselves!. Judge for Yourselves! was published posthumously in 1876. Here is an interesting quote from For Self Examination.If in observing the present state of the world and life in general, from a Christian point of view one had to say (and from a Christian point of view with complete justification): It is a disease. And if I were a physician and someone asked me \"What do you think should be done?\" I would answer, \"The first thing, the unconditional condition for anything to be done, consequently the very first thing that must be done is: create silence, bring about silence; God's Word cannot be heard, and if in order to be heard in the hullabaloo it must be shouted deafeningly with noisy instruments, then it is not God\u2019s Word; create silence!\nAh, everything is noisy; and just as strong drink is said to stir the blood, so everything in our day, even the most insignificant project, even the most empty communication, is designed merely to jolt the senses and to stir up the masses, the crowd, the public, noise!\n\nAnd man, this clever fellow, seems to have become sleepless in order to invent ever new instruments to increase noise, to spread noise and insignificance with the greatest possible haste and on the greatest possible scale. Yes, everything is soon turned upside-down: communication is indeed soon brought to its lowest point in regard to meaning, and simultaneously the means of communication are indeed brought to their highest with regard to speedy and overall circulation; for what is publicized with such hot haste and, on the other hand, what has greater circulation than\u2014rubbish! Oh, create silence!\u201d Soren Kierkegaard, For Self-Examination 1851 p. 47-48 Hong 1990\nIn 1851 Kierkegaard wrote his Two Discourses at the Communion on Fridays where he once more discussed sin, forgiveness, and authority using that same verse from 1 Peter 4:8 that he used twice in 1843 with his  Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843. Would that there were a hiding place where I am so hidden that not even the consciousness of my sin can find me! Would that there were a border, however narrow, if it still makes a separation between me and my sin! Would that on the other side of a chasmic abyss there were a spot, however little, where I could stand, while the consciousness of my sin must remain on the other side. Would that there were a forgiveness, a forgiveness that does not increase my sense of guilt but truly takes the guilt from me, also the consciousness of it. Would that there were oblivion! But now this is indeed that way it is, because love (Christ's love) hides a multitude of sins. Behold, everything has become new. .... A human being has no authority, cannot command that you shall believe and just by commanding you with authority help you to believe. But if it requires authority even to teach, what authority is required, even greater, if possible, then the authority that commands the heaving sea to be still, to command the despairing person, the one who in the agony of repentance is unable and does not dare to forget, the prostrate penitent who is unable and does not dare to stop staring at his guilt, what authority is required to command him to shut his eyes, and what authority is then required to command him to open the eyes of faith so that he sees purity where he saw guilt and sin! That divine authority he alone has, Jesus Christ, whose love hides a multitude of sins. He hides it very literally. Just as when one person places himself in front of another person and covers him so completely with his body that no one, no one, can see the person hidden behind him, so Jesus Christ covers your sin with his holy body.\nSoren Kierkegaard, Two Discourses at Friday Communion, 1851 (Love Will Hide a Multitude of Sins 1 Peter 4:8) From Without Authority, Hong 1997 p. 184-185\nKierkegaard began his 1843 book Either\/Or with a question: \"Are passions, then, the pagans of the soul? Reason alone baptized?\" He didn't want to devote himself to Thought or Speculation like Hegel did. Faith, hope, love, peace, patience, joy, self-control, vanity, kindness, humility, courage, cowardliness, pride, deceit, and selfishness. These are the inner passions that Thought knows little about. Hegel begins the process of education with Thought but Kierkegaard thinks we could begin with passion, or a balance between the two, a balance between Goethe and Hegel. He was against endless reflection with no passion involved. But at the same time he did not want to draw more attention to the external display of passion but the internal (hidden) passion of the single individual. Kierkegaard clarified this intention in his Journals.\nSchelling put Nature first and Hegel put Reason first but Kierkegaard put the human being first and the choice first in his writings. He makes an argument against Nature here and points out that most single individuals begin life as spectators of the visible world and work toward knowledge of the invisible world. Is it a perfection on the part of the bird that in hard times it sits and dies of hunger and knows of nothing at all to do, that, dazed, it lets itself fall to the ground and dies? Usually we do not talk this way. When a sailor lies down in the boat and lets matters take their course in the storm and knows nothing to do, we do not speak of his perfection. But when a doughty sailor knows how to steer, when he works against the storm with ingenuity, with strength, and with perseverance, when he works himself out of the danger, we admire him. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, 1847, Hong p.\u00a0198 Suppose that it were not one man who traveled from Jericho to Jerusalem, but there were two, and both of them were assaulted by robbers and maimed, and no traveler passed by. Suppose, then, that one of them did nothing but moan, while the other forgot and surmounted his own suffering to speak comfortingly, friendly words or, what involved great pain, dragged himself to some water to fetch the other a refreshing drink. Or suppose that they were both bereft of speech, but one of them in his silent prayer sighed to God also for the other-was he then not merciful? If someone has cut off my hands, then I cannot play the zither, and if someone has cut off my feet, then I cannot dance, and if I lie crippled on the shore, then I cannot throw myself into the sea to rescue another person's life, and if I myself am lying with a broken arm or leg, then I cannot plunge into the flames to save another's life-but I can still be merciful. I have often pondered how a painter might portray mercifulness, but I have decided that it cannot be done. As soon as a painter is to do it, it becomes dubious whether it is mercifulness or it is something else.\nSoren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, Hong 1995 p. 324Seek Ye First God's Kingdom And His Righteousness Matthew 6:33\nBut what does this mean, what have I to do, or what sort of effort is it that can be said to seek or pursue the kingdom of God? Shall I try to get a job suitable to my talents and powers in order thereby to exert an influence? No, thou shalt first seek God's kingdom. Shall I then give all my fortune to the poor? No, thou shalt first seek God's kingdom. Shall I then go out to proclaim this teaching to the world? No, thou shalt first seek God's kingdom. But then in a certain sense it is nothing I shall do. Yes, certainly, in a certain it is nothing, thou shalt in the deepest sense make thyself nothing, become nothing before God, learn to keep silent; in this silence is the beginning, which is, first to seek God's kingdom. In this wise, a godly wise, one gets to the beginning by going, in a sense, backwards. The beginning is not that with which one begins, but at which one arrives at the beginning backwards. The beginning is this art of becoming silent; for to be silent, as nature is, is not an art. It is man's superiority over the beasts to be able to speak; but in relation to God it can easily become the ruin of man who is able to speak that he is too willing to speak. God is love, man is (as one says to a child) a silly little thing, even so far as his own wellbeing is concerned. Only in much fear and trembling can a man walk with God; in much fear and trembling. But to talk in much fear and trembling is difficult for as a sense of dread causes the bodily voice to fail; so also does much fear and trembling render the voice mute in silence. This the true man of prayer knows well, and he who was not the true man of prayer learned precisely this by praying.\n\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Christian Discourses, 1848 Lowrie 1940, 1961 p. 322\nNikolai Berdyaev makes a related argument against reason in his 1945 book The Divine and the Human.\nAttack upon the Lutheran State Church\nKierkegaard's final years were taken up with a sustained, outright attack on the Church of Denmark by means of newspaper articles published in The Fatherland (F\u00e6drelandet) and a series of self-published pamphlets called The Moment (\u00d8jeblikket), also translated as The Instant. These pamphlets are now included in Kierkegaard's Attack Upon Christendom. The Moment was translated into German and other European languages in 1861 and again in 1896.Kierkegaard first moved to action after Professor (soon Bishop) Hans Lassen Martensen gave a speech in church in which he called the recently deceased Bishop Jacob Peter Mynster a \"truth-witness, one of the authentic truth-witnesses\". Kierkegaard explained, in his first article, that Mynster's death permitted him\u2014at last\u2014to be frank about his opinions. He later wrote that all his former output had been \"preparations\" for this attack, postponed for years waiting for two preconditions: 1) both his father and bishop Mynster should be dead before the attack, and 2) he should himself have acquired a name as a famous theologic writer. Kierkegaard's father had been Mynster's close friend, but S\u00f8ren had long come to see that Mynster's conception of Christianity was mistaken, demanding too little of its adherents. Kierkegaard strongly objected to the portrayal of Mynster as a 'truth-witness'.\n\nKierkegaard described the hope the witness to the truth has in 1847 and in his Journals. When the concepts are shaken in an upheaval that is more terrible than an earthquake, when the truth is hated and its witness persecuted-what then? Must the witness submit to the world? Yes. But does that mean all is lost? No, on the contrary. We remain convinced of this, and thus no proof is needed, for if it is not so, then such a person is not a witness to the truth either. Therefore we are reassured that even in the last moments such a person has retained a youthful recollection of what the youth expected, and he therefore has examined himself and his relationship before God to see whether the defect could lie in him, whether it was not possible for it to become, as the youth had expected, something he perhaps now desired most for the sake of the world-namely, that truth has the victory and good has its reward in the world.  Woe to the one who presumptuously, precipitously, and impetuously brings the horror of confusion into more peaceable situations; but woe, also, to the one who, if it was necessary, did not have the bold confidence to turn everything around the second time when it was turned around the first time!  S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 330 Relating oneself to the ideal in one's personal life is never seen. Such a life is the life of the witness to the truth. This rubric disappeared long ago, and preachers, philosophy professors, and poets have taken over the place of servants to the truth, whereby they no doubt are served very well \u2013 but they do not serve the truth. Soren Kierkegaard, Journals X 1A 11\nKierkegaard's pamphlets and polemical books, including The Moment, criticized several aspects of church formalities and politics. According to Kierkegaard, the idea of congregations keeps individuals as children since Christians are disinclined from taking the initiative to take responsibility for their own relation to God. He stressed that \"Christianity is the individual, here, the single individual\". Furthermore, since the Church was controlled by the State, Kierkegaard believed the State's bureaucratic mission was to increase membership and oversee the welfare of its members. More members would mean more power for the clergymen: a corrupt ideal. This mission would seem at odds with Christianity's true doctrine, which, to Kierkegaard, is to stress the importance of the individual, not the whole. Thus, the state-church political structure is offensive and detrimental to individuals, since anyone can become \"Christian\" without knowing what it means to be Christian. It is also detrimental to the religion itself since it reduces Christianity to a mere fashionable tradition adhered to by unbelieving \"believers\", a \"herd mentality\" of the population, so to speak. Kierkegaard always stressed the importance of the conscience and the use of it. Nonetheless, Kierkegaard has been described as \"profoundly Lutheran.\"\nDeath\nBefore the tenth issue of his periodical The Moment could be published, Kierkegaard collapsed on the street. He stayed in the hospital for over a month and refused communion. At that time he regarded pastors as mere political officials, a niche in society who were clearly not representative of the divine. He told Emil Boesen, a friend since childhood, who kept a record of his conversations with Kierkegaard, that his life had been one of immense suffering, which may have seemed like vanity to others, but he did not think it so.\nKierkegaard died in Frederiks Hospital after over a month, possibly from complications from a fall from a tree in his youth. It has been suggested by professor Kaare Weismann and literature scientist Jens Staubrand that Kierkegaard died from Pott disease, a form of tuberculosis. He was interred in the Assistens Kirkeg\u00e5rd in the N\u00f8rrebro section of Copenhagen. At Kierkegaard's funeral, his nephew Henrik Lund caused a disturbance by protesting Kierkegaard's burial by the official church. Lund maintained that Kierkegaard would never have approved, had he been alive, as he had broken from and denounced the institution. Lund was later fined for his disruption of a funeral.Reception\n19th-century reception\nIn September 1850, the Western Literary Messenger wrote: \"While Martensen with his wealth of genius casts from his central position light upon every sphere of existence, upon all the phenomena of life, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard stands like another Simon Stylites, upon his solitary column, with his eye unchangeably fixed upon one point.\" In 1855, the Danish National Church published his obituary. Kierkegaard did have an impact there judging from the following quote from their article: \"The fatal fruits which Dr. Kierkegaard show to arise from the union of Church and State, have strengthened the scruples of many of the believing laity, who now feel that they can remain no longer in the Church, because thereby they are in communion with unbelievers, for there is no ecclesiastical discipline.\"\nChanges did occur in the administration of the Church and these changes were linked to Kierkegaard's writings. The Church noted that dissent was \"something foreign to the national mind\". On 5 April 1855 the Church enacted new policies: \"every member of a congregation is free to attend the ministry of any clergyman, and is not, as formerly, bound to the one whose parishioner he is\". In March 1857, compulsory infant baptism was abolished. Debates sprang up over the King's position as the head of the Church and over whether to adopt a constitution. Grundtvig objected to having any written rules. Immediately following this announcement the \"agitation occasioned by Kierkegaard\" was mentioned. Kierkegaard was accused of Weigelianism and Darbyism, but the article continued to say, \"One great truth has been made prominent, viz (namely): That there exists a worldly-minded clergy; that many things in the Church are rotten; that all need daily repentance; that one must never be contented with the existing state of either the Church or her pastors.\"Hans Martensen was the subject of a Danish article, Dr. S. Kierkegaard against Dr. H. Martensen By Hans Peter Kofoed-Hansen (1813\u20131893) that was published in 1856 (untranslated) and Martensen mentioned him extensively in Christian Ethics, published in 1871. \"Kierkegaard's assertion is therefore perfectly justifiable, that with the category of \"the individual\" the cause of Christianity must stand and fall; that, without this category, Pantheism had conquered unconditionally. From this, at a glance, it may be seen that Kierkegaard ought to have made common cause with those philosophic and theological writers who specially desired to promote the principle of Personality as opposed to Pantheism. This is, however, far from the case. For those views which upheld the category of existence and personality, in opposition to this abstract idealism, did not do this in the sense of an either\u2014or, but in that of a both\u2014and. They strove to establish the unity of existence and idea, which may be specially seen from the fact that they desired system and totality. Martensen accused Kierkegaard and Alexandre Vinet of not giving society its due. He said both of them put the individual above society, and in so doing, above the Church.\" Another early critic was Magn\u00fas Eir\u00edksson who criticized Martensen and wanted Kierkegaard as his ally in his fight against speculative theology.\n\n\"August Strindberg was influenced by the Danish individualistic philosopher Kierkegaard while a student at Uppsala University (1867\u20131870) and mentioned him in his book Growth of a Soul as well as Zones of the Spirit (1913). Edwin Bjorkman credited Kierkegaard as well as Henry Thomas Buckle and Eduard von Hartmann with shaping Strindberg's artistic form until he was strong enough to stand wholly on his own feet.\" The dramatist Henrik Ibsen is said to have become interested in Kierkegaard as well as the Norwegian national writer and poet Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson (1832\u20131910) who named one of his characters S\u00f8ren Pedersen in his 1890 book In God's Way. Kierkegaard's father's name was Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard.Several of Kierkegaard's works were translated into German from 1861 onward, including excerpts from Practice in Christianity (1872), from Fear and Trembling and Concluding Unscientific Postscript (1874), Four Upbuilding Discourses and Christian Discourses (1875), and The Lillis of the Field and the Birds of the Air (1876) according to Kierkegaard's International Reception: Northern and Western Europe: Toma I, by John Stewart, see p.\u00a0388ff' The Sickness Unto Death, 1881   Twelve speeches by S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, by Julius Fricke, 1886 Stages on Life's Way, 1886 (B\u00e4rthold).\nOtto Pfleiderer in The Philosophy of Religion: On the Basis of Its History (1887), claimed that Kierkegaard presented an anti-rational view of Christianity. He went on to assert that the ethical side of a human being has to disappear completely in his one-sided view of faith as the highest good. He wrote, \"Kierkegaard can only find true Christianity in entire renunciation of the world, in the following of Christ in lowliness and suffering especially when met by hatred and persecution on the part of the world. Hence his passionate polemic against ecclesiastical Christianity, which he says has fallen away from Christ by coming to a peaceful understanding with the world and conforming itself to the world's life. True Christianity, on the contrary, is constant polemical pathos, a battle against reason, nature, and the world; its commandment is enmity with the world; its way of life is the death of the naturally human.\"An article from an 1889 dictionary of religion revealed a good idea of how Kierkegaard was regarded at that time, stating: \"Having never left his native city more than a few days at a time, excepting once, when he went to Germany to study Schelling's philosophy. He was the most original thinker and theological philosopher the North ever produced. His fame has been steadily growing since his death, and he bids fair to become the leading religio-philosophical light of Germany. Not only his theological but also his aesthetic works have of late become the subject of universal study in Europe.\"\nEarly-20th-century reception\n\nThe first academic to draw attention to Kierkegaard was fellow Dane Georg Brandes, who published in German as well as Danish. Brandes gave the first formal lectures on Kierkegaard in Copenhagen and helped bring him to the attention of the European intellectual community. Brandes published the first book on Kierkegaard's philosophy and life, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, ein literarisches Charakterbild. Autorisirte deutsche Ausg (1879) which Adolf Hult said was a \"misconstruction\" of Kierkegaard's work and \"falls far short of the truth\". Brandes compared him to Hegel and Tycho Brahe in Reminiscences of my Childhood and Youth (1906). Brandes also discussed the Corsair Affair in the same book. Brandes opposed Kierkegaard's ideas in the 1911 edition of the Britannica. Brandes compared Kierkegaard to Nietzsche as well. He also mentioned Kierkegaard extensively in volume 2 of his 6 volume work, Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature (1872 in German and Danish, 1906 English). There are two types of the artistic soul. There is the one which needs many varying experiences and constantly changing models, and which instantly gives a poetic form to every fresh incident. There is the other which requires amazingly few outside elements to fertilise it, and for which a single life circumstance, inscribed with sufficient force, can furnish a whole wealth of ever-changing thought and modes of expression. Soren Kierkegaard among writers, and Max Klinger among painters, are both great examples of the latter type. To which did Shakespeare belong? William Shakespeare; a critical study, by George Brandes. 1898 p. 195\nSwedish author Waldemar Rudin published S\u00f6ren Kierkegaards person och f\u00f6rfattarskap \u2013 ett f\u00f6rs\u00f6k in 1880. During the 1890s, Japanese philosophers began disseminating the works of Kierkegaard. Tetsuro Watsuji was one of the first philosophers outside of Scandinavia to write an introduction on his philosophy, in 1915.\n\nHarald H\u00f8ffding wrote an article about him in A brief history of modern philosophy (1900). H\u00f8ffding mentioned Kierkegaard in Philosophy of Religion 1906, and the American Journal of Theology (1908) printed an article about Hoffding's Philosophy of Religion. Then H\u00f8ffding repented of his previous convictions in The problems of philosophy (1913). H\u00f8ffding was also a friend of the American philosopher William James, and although James had not read Kierkegaard's works, as they were not yet translated into English, he attended the lectures about Kierkegaard by H\u00f8ffding and agreed with much of those lectures. James' favorite quote from Kierkegaard came from H\u00f8ffding: \"We live forwards but we understand backwards\". Kierkegaard wrote of moving forward past the irresolute good intention:The yes of the promise is sleep-inducing, but the no, spoken and therefore audible to oneself, is awakening, and repentance is usually not far away. The one who says, \"I will, sir,\" is at the same moment pleased with himself; the one who says no becomes almost afraid of himself. But this difference if very significant in the first moment and very decisive in the next moment; yet if the first moment is the judgment of the momentary, the second moment is the judgment of eternity. This is precisely why the world is so inclined to promises, inasmuch as the world is the momentary, and at the moment a promise looks very good. This is why eternity is suspicious of promises, just as it is suspicious of everything momentary. And so it is also with the one who, rich in good intentions and quick to promise, moves backward further and further away from the good. By means of the intention and the promise, he is facing in the direction of the good, is turned toward the good but is moving backward further and further away from it. With every renewed intention and promise it looks as if he took a step forward, and yet he is not merely standing still, but he is actually taking a step backward. The intention taken in vain, the unfulfilled promise, leaves despondency, dejection, that in turn perhaps soon blazes up into an even more vehement intention, which leaves only greater listlessness. Just as the alcoholic continually needs a stronger and stronger stimulant-in order to become intoxicated, likewise the one who has become addicted to promises and good intentions continually needs more and more stimulation-in order to go backward. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, Hong p. 93-94 (1850)\nOne thing James did have in common with Kierkegaard was respect for the single individual, and their respective comments may be compared in direct sequence as follows: \"A crowd is indeed made up of single individuals; it must therefore be in everyone's power to become what he is, a single individual; no one is prevented from being a single individual, no one, unless he prevents himself by becoming many. To become a crowd, to gather a crowd around oneself, is on the contrary to distinguish life from life; even the most well-meaning one who talks about that, can easily offend a single individual.\" In his book A Pluralistic Universe, James stated that, \"Individuality outruns all classification, yet we insist on classifying every one we meet under some general label. As these heads usually suggest prejudicial associations to some hearer or other, the life of philosophy largely consists of resentments at the classing, and complaints of being misunderstood. But there are signs of clearing up for which both Oxford and Harvard are partly to be thanked.\"The Encyclopaedia of religion and ethics had an article about Kierkegaard in 1908. The article began:\n\n\"The life of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard has but few points of contact with the external world; but there were, in particular, three occurrences\u2014a broken engagement, an attack by a comic paper, and the use of a word by H.L. Martensen\u2014which must be referred to as having wrought with extraordinary effect upon his peculiarly sensitive and high-strung nature. The intensity of his inner life, again\u2014which finds expression in his published works, and even more directly in his notebooks and diaries (also published)\u2014cannot be properly understood without some reference to his father.\"Friedrich von H\u00fcgel wrote about Kierkegaard in his 1913 book, Eternal life: a study of its implications and applications, where he said: \"Kierkegaard, the deep, melancholy, strenuous, utterly uncompromising Danish religionist, is a spiritual brother of the great Frenchman, Blaise Pascal, and of the striking English Tractarian, Hurrell Froude, who died young and still full of crudity, yet left an abiding mark upon all who knew him well.\"John George Robertson wrote an article called Soren Kierkegaard in 1914: \"Notwithstanding the fact that during the last quarter of a century, we have devoted considerable attention to the literatures of the North, the thinker and man of letters whose name stands at the head of the present article is but little known to the English-speaking world. The Norwegians, Ibsen and Bj\u00f8rnson, have exerted a very real power on our intellectual life, and for Bj\u00f8rnson we have cherished even a kind of affection. But Kierkegaard, the writer who holds the indispensable key to the intellectual life of Scandinavia, to whom Denmark in particular looks up as her most original man of genius in the nineteenth century, we have wholly overlooked.\" Robertson wrote previously in Cosmopolis (1898) about Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. Theodor Haecker wrote an essay titled, Kierkegaard and the Philosophy of Inwardness in 1913 and David F. Swenson wrote a biography of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard in 1920. Lee M. Hollander translated parts of Either\/Or, Fear and Trembling, Stages on Life's Way, and Preparations for the Christian Life (Practice in Christianity) into English in 1923, with little impact. Swenson wrote about Kierkegaard's idea of \"armed neutrality\" in 1918 and a lengthy article about S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard in 1920. Swenson stated: \"It would be interesting to speculate upon the reputation that Kierkegaard might have attained, and the extent of the influence he might have exerted, if he had written in one of the major European languages, instead of in the tongue of one of the smallest countries in the world.\"Austrian psychologist Wilhelm Stekel (1868\u20131940) referred to Kierkegaard as the \"fanatical follower of Don Juan, himself the philosopher of Don Juanism\" in his book Disguises of Love. German psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers (1883\u20131969) stated he had been reading Kierkegaard since 1914 and compared Kierkegaard's writings with Friedrich Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind and the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche. Jaspers saw Kierkegaard as a champion of Christianity and Nietzsche as a champion for atheism. Later, in 1935, Karl Jaspers emphasized Kierkegaard's (and Nietzsche's) continuing importance for modern philosophy\nGerman and English translators of Kierkegaard's works\nAlbert Barthod began translating Kierkegaard's works into German as early as 1873. Hermann Gottsche published Kierkegaard's Journals in 1905. It had taken academics 50 years to arrange his journals. Kierkegaard's main works were translated into German by Christoph Schrempf from 1909 onwards. Emmanuel Hirsch released a German edition of Kierkegaard's collected works from 1950 onwards. Both Harald Hoffding's and Schrempf's books about Kierkegaard were reviewed in 1892.In the 1930s, the first academic English translations, by Alexander Dru, David F. Swenson, Douglas V. Steere, and Walter Lowrie appeared, under the editorial efforts of Oxford University Press editor Charles Williams, one of the members of the Inklings. Thomas Henry Croxall, another early translator, Lowrie, and Dru all hoped that people would not just read about Kierkegaard but would actually read his works. Dru published an English translation of Kierkegaard's Journals in 1958; Alastair Hannay translated some of Kierkegaard's works. From the 1960s to the 1990s, Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong translated his works more than once. The first volume of their first version of the Journals and Papers (Indiana, 1967\u20131978) won the 1968 U.S. National Book Award in category Translation. They both dedicated their lives to the study of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and his works, which are maintained at the Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library. Jon Stewart from the University of Copenhagen has written extensively about S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard.\n\nKierkegaard's influence on Karl Barth's early theology\nKierkegaard's influence on Karl Barth's early theology is evident in The Epistle to the Romans. The early Barth read at least three volumes of Kierkegaard's works: Practice in Christianity, The Moment, and an Anthology from his journals and diaries. Almost all key terms from Kierkegaard which had an important role in The Epistle to the Romans can be found in Practice in Christianity. The concept of the indirect communication, the paradox, and the moment of Practice in Christianity, in particular, confirmed and sharpened Barth's ideas on contemporary Christianity and the Christian life.\n\nWilhelm Pauk wrote in 1931 (Karl Barth Prophet of a New Christianity) that Kierkegaard's use of the Latin phrase Finitum Non Capax Infiniti (the finite does not (or cannot) comprehend the infinite) summed up Barth's system. David G. Kingman and Adolph Keller each discussed Barth's relationship to Kierkegaard in their books, The Religious Educational Values in Karl Barth's Teachings (1934) and Karl Barth and Christian Unity (1933). Keller notes the splits that happen when a new teaching is introduced and some assume a higher knowledge from a higher source than others. But Kierkegaard always referred to the equality of all in the world of the spirit where there is neither \"sport\" nor \"spook\" or anyone who can shut you out of the world of the spirit except yourself. All are chosen by God and equal in His sight. The Expectancy of Faith,\" Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith. Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law. You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. The Bible \u2013 NIV\" Galatians 3:23\u201329; \"In the world of spirit to become one\u2019s own master, is the highest \u2013 and in love to help someone toward that, to become himself, free, independent, his own master, to help him stand alone \u2013 that is the greatest beneficence. The greatest beneficence, to help the other to stand alone, cannot be done directly.\" \"If a person always keeps his soul sober and alert in this idea, he will never go astray in his outlook on life and people or \"combine respect for status of persons with his faith.\" Show no partiality as you hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. (James 2.1) Then he will direct his thoughts toward God, and his eye will not make the mistake of looking for differences in the world instead of likeness with God.It was in his study of Paul that he found his first peace of mind. He was fascinated by the revelation of the power of the Holy Spirit when it once touched a man; at the completeness with which it overwhelms and keeps its chosen ones loyal. He conceived of Paul as one upon whom God had laid His hand' Barth writes: \"The man Paul evidently sees and hears something which is above everything, which is absolutely beyond the range of my observation and measure of my thought.\" Following this observation Barth too became a \"listener\" and in that moment was born the \"Theology of Crisis.\" Besides affecting Barth deeply, the philosophy of Kierkegaard has found voice in the works of Ibsen, Unamuno, and Heidegger, and its sphere of influence seems to be growing in ever widening circles. The principle contribution of Kierkegaard to Barth is the dualism of time and eternity which Kierkegaard phrases: \"The infinite qualitative difference between time and eternity.\"\nWherever Kierkegaard is understood, opposition is aroused to organized ecclesiasticism, to the objective treatment of religious questions, to the sovereignty of man, whether it be called idealism or theology of mystical experience. In this Kierkegaard circle of young pastors and pupils of Geismar there arose not only resistance against the teacher himself, whom they accused of failing to present Kierkegaard's ideas as sufficiently radical, but also against the prevalent work of the church as such. The work with the youth, the work with Home Missions appears as superficial church business. In Grundtvigianism they frequently saw secularized piety, which had gone over to a concern with all sorts of cultural possessions. The majesty of God seemed to have been preserved too little and the institution of the church seemed to have taken over the meaning of the existential meeting with the transcendent God. In this opposition to the prevalent church life the thoughts of Kierkegaard have certainly remained alive. However, they became effective only when their reinforced echo from foreign lands reached Denmark. This effect was more marked when Barthianism became known. Into this group of dissatisfied, excited radicals Barthian thought penetrated with full force. The inward distress, the tension and the preparation of Kierkegaard made them receptive to the new. A magazine entitled the Tidenverv (The Turn of the Times), has been their journal since 1926. Especially the Student Christian Movement became the port of invasion for the new thought. But this invasion has been split completely into two camps which vehemently attack each other. Indictment was launched against the old theology. The quiet work of the church was scorned as secularization of the message or as emotional smugness, which had found a place in Home Missions despite all its call to repentance.\nKierkegaard and the early Barth think that in Christianity, direct communication is impossible because Christ appears incognito. For them Christ is a paradox, and therefore one can know him only in indirect communication. They are fully aware of the importance of the moment when the human being stands before God, and is moved by him alone from time to eternity, from the earth to which (s)he belongs to the heaven where God exists. But Kierkegaard stressed the single individual in the presence of God in time in his early discourses and wrote against speculative arguments about whether or not one individual, no matter how gifted, can ascertain where another stood in relation to God as early as his Two Upbuilding Discourses of 1843 where he wrote against listening to speculative Christians: The expectation of faith is then victory, and this expectation cannot be disappointed unless a man disappoints himself by depriving himself of expectation; like the one who foolishly supposed that he had lost faith, or foolishly supposed that some individual had taken it from him; or like the one who sought to delude himself with the idea that there was some special power which could deprive a man of his faith; who found satisfaction in the vain thought that this was precisely what had happened to him, found joy in frightening others with the assurance that some such power did exist that made sport of the noblest in man, and empowered the one who was thus tested to ridicule others. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Two Edifying Discourses 1843, Swenson trans., 1943 p. 30\nBarth endorses the main theme from Kierkegaard but also reorganizes the scheme and transforms the details. Barth expands the theory of indirect communication to the field of Christian ethics; he applies the concept of unrecognizability to the Christian life. He coins the concept of the \"paradox of faith\" since the form of faith entails a contradictory encounter of God and human beings. He also portrayed the contemporaneity of the moment when in crisis a human being desperately perceives the contemporaneity of Christ. In regard to the concept of indirect communication, the paradox, and the moment, the Kierkegaard of the early Barth is a productive catalyst.\n\"If I have a system it is limited to a recognition of what Kierkegaard called the 'infinite qualitative distinction' and to my regarding this as possessing negative as well as positive significance: 'God is in heaven. And thou art on earth.' The relation between such a God and such a man, and the relation between such a man and such a God, is for me the theme of the Bible and the essence of philosophy. Philosophers name this KRISIS of human perception- the Prime Cause: the Bible holds at the same cross-roads-the figure of Jesus Christ. When I am faced by such a document as the Epistle of Paul to the Romans, I embark on its interpretation on the assumption that he is confronted with the same unmistakable and unmeasurable significance of that relation as I myself am confronted with, and that it is this situation which moulds his thought and its expression\". Karl Barth, The Epistle to the Romans 1919 Preface (originally published in German)\nLater-20th-century reception\n\nWilliam Hubben compared Kierkegaard to Dostoevsky in his 1952 book Four Prophets of Our Destiny, later titled Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Kafka. Logic and human reasoning are inadequate to comprehend truth, and in this emphasis Dostoevsky speaks entirely the language of Kierkegaard, of whom he had never heard. Christianity is a way of life, an existential condition. Again, like Kierkegaard, who affirmed that suffering is the climate in which man's soul begins to breathe. Dostoevsky stresses the function of suffering as part of God's revelation of truth to man. Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Kafka by William Hubben 1952 McMillan p. 83\nIn 1955 Morton White wrote about the word \"exists\" and Kierkegaard's idea of God's is-ness. The word \"exists\" is one of the most pivotal and controversial in philosophy. Some philosophers think of it as having one meaning: the sense in which we say that this book exists, that God does or does not exist, that there exist odd numbers between 8 and 20, that a characteristic like redness exists as well as things that are red, that the American government exists as well as the physical building in which the government is housed, that minds exist as well as bodies. And when the word \"exists\" is construed in this unambiguous way, many famous disputes in the history of philosophy and theology appear to be quite straightforward. Theists affirm that God exists while atheists deny the very same statement; materialists say that matter exists while some idealists think that it is illusory; nominalists, as they are called, deny the existence of characteristics like redness while platonic realists affirm it; some kinds of behaviorists deny that there are minds inside bodies. There is, however, a tendency among some philosophers, to insist that the word \"exists\" is ambiguous and therefore that some of these disputes are not disputes at all but merely the results of mutual misunderstanding, of a failure to see that certain things are said to exist in one sense while others exist in another. One of the outstanding efforts of this kind in the twentieth century occurs in the early writings of realists who maintained that only concrete things in space and time exist, while abstract characteristics of things or relations between them should be said to subsist. This is sometimes illustrated by pointing out that while Chicago and St. Louis both exist at definite places, the relation more populous than which holds between them exists neither in Chicago nor in St. Louis nor in the area between them, but is nevertheless something about which we can speak, something that is usually assigned to a timeless and spaceless realm like that of which Plato spoke. On this view, however, human minds or personalities are also said to exist in spite of being non-material. In short, the great divide is between abstract subsistents and concrete existents, but both human personalities and physical objects are existents and do not share in the spacelessness and timelessness of platonic ideas.\nSo far as one can see, Kierkegaard too distinguishes different senses of \"exists\", except that he appears to need at least three distinct senses for which he should supply three distinct words. First of all he needs one for statements about God, and so he says that God is. Secondly, and by contrast, persons or personalities are said to exist. It would appear then that he needs some third term for physical objects, which on his view are very different from God and persons, but since existentialists don\u2019t seem to be very interested in physical objects or \"mere\" things, they appear to get along with two. The great problem for Kierkegaard is to relate God\u2019s is-ness, if I may use that term for the moment, to human existence, and this he tries to solve by appealing to the Incarnation. Christ\u2019s person is the existent outgrowth of God who is. By what is admittedly a mysterious process the abstract God enters a concrete existent. We must accept this on faith and faith alone, for clearly it cannot be like the process whereby one existent is related to another; it involves a passage from one realm to another which is not accessible to the human mind, Christians who lacked this faith and who failed to live by it were attacked by Kierkegaard; this was the theological root of his violent criticism of the Established Church of Denmark. It is one source of his powerful influence on contemporary theology.\n\n20th Century Philosophers, The Age of Analysis, selected with introduction and commentary by Morton White 1955 p. 118-121 Houghton Mifflin Co\nJohn Daniel Wild noted as early as 1959 that Kierkegaard's works had been \"translated into almost every important living language including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and it is now fair to say that his ideas are almost as widely known and as influential in the world as those of his great opponent Hegel, still the most potent of world philosophers.\"\nMortimer J. Adler wrote the following about Kierkegaard in 1962:  For Kierkegaard, man is essentially an individual, not a member of a species or race; and ethical and religious truth is known through individual existence and decision-through subjectivity, not objectivity. Systems of thought and a dialectic such as Hegel's are matters merely of thought, which cannot comprise individual existence and decision. Such systems leave out, said Kierkegaard, the unique and essential \"spermatic point, the individual, ethically and religiously conceived, and existentially accentuated\". Similarly in the works of the American author Henry David Thoreau, writing at the same time as Kierkegaard, there is an emphasis on the solitary individual as the bearer of ethical responsibility, who, when he is right, carries the preponderant ethical weight against the state, government, and a united public opinion, when they are wrong. The solitary individual with right on his side is always \"a majority of one\". Ethics, the study of moral values, by Mortimer J. Adler and Seymour Cain. Pref. by William Ernest Hocking. 1962 p. 252\nIn 1964 Life Magazine traced the history of existentialism from Heraclitus (500BC) and Parmenides over the argument over The Unchanging One as the real and the state of flux as the real. From there to the Old Testament Psalms and then to Jesus and later from Jacob Boehme (1575\u20131624) to Rene Descartes (1596\u20131650) and Blaise Pascal (1623\u20131662) and then on to Nietzsche and Paul Tillich. Dostoevski and Camus are attempts to rewrite Descartes according to their own lights and Descartes is the forefather of Sartre through the fact that they both used a \"literary style.\" The article goes on to say,  But the orthodox, textbook precursor of modern existentialism was the Danish theologian S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855), a lonely, hunchbacked writer who denounced the established church and rejected much of the then-popular German idealism \u2013 in which thought and ideas, rather than things perceived through the senses, were held to constitute reality. He built a philosophy based in part on the idea of permanent cleavage between faith and reason. This was an existentialism which still had room for a God whom Sartre later expelled, but which started the great pendulum-swing toward the modern concepts of the absurd. Kierkegaard spent his life thinking existentially and converting remarkably few to his ideas. But when it comes to the absurdity of existence, war is a great convincer; and it was at the end of World War I that two German philosophers, Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger, took up Kierkegaard's ideas, elaborated and systematized them. By the 1930s Kierkegaard's thinking made new impact on French intellectuals who, like Sartre, were nauseated by the static pre-Munich hypocrisy of the European middle class. After World War II, with the human condition more precarious than ever, with humanity facing the mushroom-shaped ultimate absurdity, existentialism and our time came together in Jean-Paul Sartre.\nExistentialism, Life, November 6, 1964, Volume 57, No. 19 ISSN 0024-3019 Published by Time Inc. P. 102-103, begins on page 86\nKierkegaard's comparatively early and manifold philosophical and theological reception in Germany was one of the decisive factors of expanding his works' influence and readership throughout the world. Important for the first phase of his reception in Germany was the establishment of the journal Zwischen den Zeiten (Between the Ages) in 1922 by a heterogeneous circle of Protestant theologians: Karl Barth, Emil Brunner, Rudolf Bultmann and Friedrich Gogarten. Their thought would soon be referred to as dialectical theology.\nAt roughly the same time, Kierkegaard was discovered by several proponents of the Jewish-Christian philosophy of dialogue in Germany, namely by Martin Buber, Ferdinand Ebner, and Franz Rosenzweig. In addition to the philosophy of dialogue, existential philosophy has its point of origin in Kierkegaard and his concept of individuality. Martin Heidegger sparsely refers to Kierkegaard in Being and Time (1927), obscuring how much he owes to him. Walter Kaufmann discussed Sartre, Jaspers, and Heidegger in relation to Kierkegaard, and Kierkegaard in relation to the crisis of religion in the 1960s. Later, Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling (Series Two) and The Sickness Unto Death (Series Three) were included in the Penguin Great Ideas Series (Two and Three).\nPhilosophy and theology\nKierkegaard has been called a philosopher, a theologian, the Father of Existentialism, both atheistic and theistic variations, a literary critic, a social theorist, a humorist, a psychologist, and a poet. Two of his influential ideas are \"subjectivity\", and the notion popularly referred to as \"leap of faith\". However, the Danish equivalent to the English phrase \"leap of faith\" does not appear in the original Danish nor is the English phrase found in current English translations of Kierkegaard's works. Kierkegaard does mention the concepts of \"faith\" and \"leap\" together many times in his works.\nThe leap of faith is his conception of how an individual would believe in God or how a person would act in love. Faith is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to completely justify the kind of total commitment involved in true religious faith or romantic love. Faith involves making that commitment anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have faith is at the same time to have doubt. So, for example, for one to truly have faith in God, one would also have to doubt one's beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the faith would have no real substance. Someone who does not realize that Christian doctrine is inherently doubtful and that there can be no objective certainty about its truth does not have faith but is merely credulous. For example, it takes no faith to believe that a pencil or a table exists, when one is looking at it and touching it. In the same way, to believe or have faith in God is to know that one has no perceptual or any other access to God, and yet still has faith in God. Kierkegaard writes, \"doubt is conquered by faith, just as it is faith which has brought doubt into the world\".Kierkegaard also stresses the importance of the self, and the self's relation to the world, as being grounded in self-reflection and introspection. He argued in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments that \"subjectivity is truth\" and \"truth is subjectivity.\" This has to do with a distinction between what is objectively true and an individual's subjective relation (such as indifference or commitment) to that truth. People who in some sense believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently. Two individuals may both believe that many of those around them are poor and deserve help, but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor. This is how Kierkegaard put it: \"What a priceless invention statistics are, what a glorious fruit of culture, what a characteristic counterpart to the de te narratur fabula [the tale is told about you] of antiquity. Schleiermacher so enthusiastically declares that knowledge does not perturb religiousness, and that the religious person does not sit safeguarded by a lightning rod and scoff at God; yet with the help of statistical tables one laughs at all of life.\" In other words, Kierkegaard says: \"Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life \u2013 or the learner who should put it to use?\" This is how it was summed up in 1940:\n\nKierkegaard does not deny the fruitfulness or validity of abstract thinking (science, logic, and so on), but he does deny any superstition which pretends that abstract theorizing is a sufficient concluding argument for human existence. He holds it to be unforgivable pride or stupidity to think that the impersonal abstraction can answer the vital problems of human, everyday life. Logical theorems, mathematical symbols, physical-statistical laws can never become patterns of human existence. To be human means to be concrete, to be this person here and now in this particular and decisive moment, face to face with this particular challenge.\nKierkegaard primarily discusses subjectivity with regard to religious matters. As already noted, he argues that doubt is an element of faith and that it is impossible to gain any objective certainty about religious doctrines such as the existence of God or the life of Christ. The most one could hope for would be the conclusion that it is probable that the Christian doctrines are true, but if a person were to believe such doctrines only to the degree they seemed likely to be true, he or she would not be genuinely religious at all. Faith consists in a subjective relation of absolute commitment to these doctrines.\nPhilosophical criticism\nKierkegaard's famous philosophical 20th-century critics include Theodor Adorno and Emmanuel Levinas. Non-religious philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger supported many aspects of Kierkegaard's philosophical views, but rejected some of his religious views. One critic wrote that Adorno's book Kierkegaard: Construction of the Aesthetic is \"the most irresponsible book ever written on Kierkegaard\" because Adorno takes Kierkegaard's pseudonyms literally and constructs a philosophy that makes him seem incoherent and unintelligible. Another reviewer says that \"Adorno is [far away] from the more credible translations and interpretations of the Collected Works of Kierkegaard we have today.\"\nLevinas' main attack on Kierkegaard focused on his ethical and religious stages, especially in Fear and Trembling. Levinas criticises the leap of faith by saying this suspension of the ethical and leap into the religious is a type of violence (the \"leap of faith\" of course, is presented by a pseudonym, thus not representing Kierkegaard's own view, but intending to prompt the exact kind of discussion engaged in by his critics). He states: \"Kierkegaardian violence begins when existence is forced to abandon the ethical stage in order to embark on the religious stage, the domain of belief. But belief no longer sought external justification. Even internally, it combined communication and isolation, and hence violence and passion. That is the origin of the relegation of ethical phenomena to secondary status and the contempt of the ethical foundation of being which has led, through Nietzsche, to the amoralism of recent philosophies.\"Levinas pointed to the Judeo-Christian belief that it was God who first commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac and that an angel commanded Abraham to stop. If Abraham were truly in the religious realm, he would not have listened to the angel's command and should have continued to kill Isaac. To Levinas, \"transcending ethics\" seems like a loophole to excuse would-be murderers from their crime and thus is unacceptable. One interesting consequence of Levinas' critique is that it seemed to reveal that Levinas viewed God as a projection of inner ethical desire rather than an absolute moral agent. However, one of Kierkegaard's central points in Fear and Trembling was that the religious sphere entails the ethical sphere; Abraham had faith that God is always in one way or another ethically in the right, even when He commands someone to kill. Therefore, deep down, Abraham had faith that God, as an absolute moral authority, would never allow him in the end to do something as ethically heinous as murdering his own child, and so he passed the test of blind obedience versus moral choice. He was making the point that God as well as the God-Man Christ doesn't tell people everything when sending them out on a mission and reiterated this in Stages on Life's Way.\n\nI conceive of God as one who approves in a calculated vigilance, I believe that he approves of intrigues, and what I have read in the sacred books of the Old Testament is not of a sort to dishearten me. The Old Testament furnishes examples abundantly of a shrewdness which is nevertheless well pleasing to God, and that at a later period Christ said to His disciples, \"These things I said not unto you from the beginning \u2026 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\" \u2013 so here is a teleological suspension of the ethical rule of telling the whole truth.\n\u2014 Soren Kierkegaard, \"Quidam's Diary\" from Stages on Life's Way, 1845. Lowrie translation, 1967, pp. 217\u2013218.\nSartre objected to the existence of God: If existence precedes essence, it follows from the meaning of the term sentient that a sentient being cannot be complete or perfect. In Being and Nothingness, Sartre's phrasing is that God would be a pour-soi (a being-for-itself; a consciousness) who is also an en-soi (a being-in-itself; a thing) which is a contradiction in terms. Critics of Sartre rebutted this objection by stating that it rests on a false dichotomy and a misunderstanding of the traditional Christian view of God. Kierkegaard has Judge Vilhelm express the Christian hope this way in Either\/Or:\n\nEither, \"the first\" contains promise for the future, is the forward thrust, the endless impulse. Or, \"the first\" does not impel the individual; the power which is in the first does not become the impelling power but the repelling power, it becomes that which thrusts away. .... Thus \u2013 for the sake of making a little philosophical flourish, not with the pen but with thought-God only once became flesh, and it would be vain to expect this to be repeated.\n\u2014 Soren Kierkegaard, Either \u2013 Or II, 1843. Lowrie translation 1944, 1959, 1972, pp. 40\u201341.\nSartre agreed with Kierkegaard's analysis of Abraham undergoing anxiety (Sartre calls it anguish), but claimed that God told Abraham to do it. In his lecture, Existentialism is a Humanism, Sartre wondered whether Abraham ought to have doubted whether God actually spoke to him. In Kierkegaard's view, Abraham's certainty had its origin in that \"inner voice\" which cannot be demonstrated or shown to another (\"The problem comes as soon as Abraham wants to be understood\"). To Kierkegaard, every external \"proof\" or justification is merely on the outside and external to the subject. Kierkegaard's proof for the immortality of the soul, for example, is rooted in the extent to which one wishes to live forever.\nFaith was something that Kierkegaard often wrestled with throughout his writing career; under both his real name and behind pseudonyms, he explored many different aspects of faith. These various aspects include faith as a spiritual goal, the historical orientation of faith (particularly toward Jesus Christ), faith being a gift from God, faith as dependency on a historical object, faith as a passion, and faith as a resolution to personal despair. Even so, it has been argued that Kierkegaard never offers a full, explicit and systematic account of what faith is. Either\/Or was published 20 February 1843; it was mostly written during Kierkegaard's stay in Berlin, where he took notes on Schelling's Philosophy of Revelation. According to the Routledge Companion to Philosophy and Religion, Either\/Or (vol. 1) consists of essays of literary and music criticism, a set of romantic-like-aphorisms, a whimsical essay on how to avoid boredom, a panegyric on the unhappiest possible human being, a diary recounting a supposed seduction, and (vol. II) two enormous didactic and hortatory ethical letters and a sermon. This opinion is a reminder of the type of controversy Kierkegaard tried to encourage in many of his writings both for readers in his own generation and for subsequent generations as well.\nKierkegaardian scholar Paul Holmer described Kierkegaard's wish in his introduction to the 1958 publication of Kierkegaard's Edifying Discourses where he wrote:\n\nKierkegaard's constant and lifelong wish, to which his entire literature gives expression, was to create a new and rich subjectivity in himself and his readers. Unlike any authors who believe that all subjectivity is a hindrance, Kierkegaard contends that only some kinds of subjectivity are a hindrance. He sought at once to produce subjectivity if it were lacking, to correct it if it were there and needed correction, to amplify and strengthen it when it was weak and undeveloped, and, always, to bring subjectivity of every reader to the point of eligibility for Christian inwardness and concern. But the Edifying Discourses, though paralleling the pseudonymous works, spoke a little more directly, albeit without authority. They spoke the real author's conviction and were the purpose of Kierkegaard's lifework. Whereas all the rest of his writing was designed to get the readers out of their lassitude and mistaken conceptions, the discourses, early and late, were the goal of the literature.\nLater, Naomi Lebowitz explained them this way: The edifying discourses are, according to Johannes Climacus, \"humoristically revoked\" (CUP, 244, Swenson, Lowrie 1968) for unlike sermons, they are not ordained by authority. They start where the reader finds himself, in immanent ethical possibilities and aesthetic repetitions, and are themselves vulnerable to the lure of poetic sirens. They force the dialectical movements of the making and unmaking of the self before God to undergo lyrical imitations of meditation while the clefts, rifts, abysses, are everywhere to be seen.\nPolitical views\nThroughout retrospective analyses Kierkegaard has been viewed as an apolitical philosopher. Despite this Kierkegaard did publish works of a political nature such as his first published essay, criticizing the women's suffragette movement.Kierkegaard frequently challenged the cultural norms of his time, particularly the quick and uncritical adoption of Hegelianism by the philosophical establishment, arguing that Hegel's system \"omits the individual\", and therefore presents an ultimately limited view of life. He attacked Hegelianism via elaborate parody throughout his works from Either\/Or to Concluding Unscientific Postscript. Despite his objections to Hegelianism, he expressed an admiration for Hegel personally and would even regard his system favourably if it was proposed as a thought experiment\nKierkegaard also attacked the elements of culture that the Enlightenment had produced such as the natural sciences and reason viewing the natural sciences, in particular, to have \"Absolutely no benefit\" and that:  One stands there defenseless, with no control over anything. The researcher immediately begins to distract one with his details: Now one is to go to Australia, now to the moon; now into a cave; now, by Satan, up the arse\u2014to look for an intestinal worm; now the telescope must be used; now the microscope: Who in the devil can endure it?\nKierkegaard leaned towards conservatism, a personal friend of Danish king Christian VIII whom he viewed as the moral superior of every Danish man, woman, and child, he argued against democracy calling it \"the most tyrannical form of government,\" arguing in favour of monarchy saying \"Is it tyranny when one person wants to rule leaving the rest of us others out? No, but it is tyranny when all want to rule.\" Matt McManus argued that Kierkegaard, while conservative himself, argues against it as a sufficient solution to give one's life meaning. Kierkegaard held strong contempt for the media, describing it as \"the most wretched, the most contemptible of all tyrannies\". He was critical of the Danish public at the time labeling them as \"the most dangerous of all powers and the most meaningless.\" Writing in Two Ages: a Literary Review that:\n\nIf I were to imagine this public as a person\u2026 I most likely would think of one of the Roman emperors, an imposing, well-fed figure suffering from boredom and therefore craving only the sensate titillation of laughter, for the divine gift of wit is not worldly enough. So this person, more sluggish than he is evil, but negatively domineering, saunters around looking for variety.\nHe displayed anti-semitic views; for example, he described The Corsair as a \"Jewish rebellion against the Christians\". He believed that in regards to serving God, sexuality was irrelevant \"before God not only for men and women, but also for homosexuals and heterosexuals\".Kierkegaard's political philosophy has been likened to Neo-Conservatism, despite its major influence on radical and anti-traditional thinkers, religious and secular, such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Jean Paul Sartre. It has also been likened to anti-establishment thought and has been described as \"a starting point for contemporary political theories\".\nInfluence\nMany 20th-century philosophers, both theistic and atheistic, and theologians drew concepts from Kierkegaard, including the notions of angst, despair, and the importance of the individual. His fame as a philosopher grew tremendously in the 1930s, in large part because the ascendant existentialist movement pointed to him as a precursor, although later writers celebrated him as a highly significant and influential thinker in his own right. Since Kierkegaard was raised as a Lutheran, he was commemorated as a teacher in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 11 November and in the Calendar of Saints of the Episcopal Church with a feast day on 8 September.\n\nPhilosophers and theologians influenced by Kierkegaard are numerous and include major twentieth century theologians and philosophers. Paul Feyerabend's epistemological anarchism in the philosophy of science was inspired by Kierkegaard's idea of subjectivity as truth. Ludwig Wittgenstein was immensely influenced and humbled by Kierkegaard, claiming that \"Kierkegaard is far too deep for me, anyhow. He bewilders me without working the good effects which he would in deeper souls\". Karl Popper referred to Kierkegaard as \"the great reformer of Christian ethics, who exposed the official Christian morality of his day as anti-Christian and anti-humanitarian hypocrisy\". Hilary Putnam admired Kierkegaard, \"for his insistence on the priority of the question, 'How should I live?'\". By the early 1930s, Jacques Ellul's three primary sources of inspiration were Karl Marx, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, and Karl Barth. According to Ellul, Marx and Kierkegaard were his two greatest influences, and the only two authors of which he read all of their work. Herbert Read wrote in 1945 \"Kierkegaard\u2019s life was in every sense that of a saint. He is perhaps the most real saint of modern times.\"Kierkegaard has also had a considerable influence on 20th-century literature. Figures deeply influenced by his work include W. H. Auden, Jorge Luis Borges, Don DeLillo, Hermann Hesse, Franz Kafka, David Lodge, Flannery O'Connor, Walker Percy, Rainer Maria Rilke, J.D. Salinger and John Updike. What George Henry Price wrote in his 1963 book The Narrow Pass regarding the \"who\" and the \"what\" of Kierkegaard still seems to hold true today: \"Kierkegaard was the sanest man of his generation....Kierkegaard was a schizophrenic....Kierkegaard was the greatest Dane....the difficult Dane....the gloomy Dane...Kierkegaard was the greatest Christian of the century....Kierkegaard's aim was the destruction of the historic Christian faith....He did not attack philosophy as such....He negated reason....He was a voluntarist....Kierkegaard was the Knight of Faith....Kierkegaard never found faith....Kierkegaard possessed the truth....Kierkegaard was one of the damned.\"\nKierkegaard had a profound influence on psychology. He is widely regarded as the founder of Christian psychology and of existential psychology and therapy. Existentialist (often called \"humanistic\") psychologists and therapists include Ludwig Binswanger, Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Carl Rogers, and Rollo May. May based his The Meaning of Anxiety on Kierkegaard's The Concept of Anxiety. Kierkegaard's sociological work Two Ages: The Age of Revolution and the Present Age critiques modernity. Ernest Becker based his 1974 Pulitzer Prize book, The Denial of Death, on the writings of Kierkegaard, Freud and Otto Rank. Kierkegaard is also seen as an important precursor of postmodernism. Danish priest Johannes M\u00f8llehave has lectured about Kierkegaard. In popular culture, he was the subject of serious television and radio programmes; in 1984, a six-part documentary Sea of Faith: Television series presented by Don Cupitt featured an episode on Kierkegaard, while on Maundy Thursday in 2008, Kierkegaard was the subject of discussion of the BBC Radio 4 programme presented by Melvyn Bragg, In Our Time, during which it was suggested that Kierkegaard straddles the analytic\/continental divide. Google honoured him with a Google Doodle on his 200th anniversary. The novel Therapy by David Lodge details a man experiencing a mid-life crisis and becoming obsessed with the works of Kierkegaard.Kierkegaard is considered by some modern theologians to be the \"Father of Existentialism\". Because of his influence and in spite of it, others only consider either Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Sartre to be the actual \"Father of Existentialism\". Kierkegaard predicted his posthumous fame, and foresaw that his work would become the subject of intense study and research.\nSelected bibliography\n(1841) On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates (Om Begrebet Ironi med stadigt Hensyn til Socrates; master's thesis)\n(1843) Either\/Or (Enten-Eller)\n(1843) Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 (To opbyggelige Taler)\n(1843) Fear and Trembling (Frygt og B\u00e6ven)\n(1843) Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 (Tre opbyggelige Taler)\n(1843) Repetition (Gjentagelsen)\n(1843) Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 (Fire opbyggelige Taler)\n(1844) Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1844 (To opbyggelige Taler)\n(1844) Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844 (Tre opbyggelige Taler)\n(1844) Philosophical Fragments (Philosophiske Smuler)\n(1844) The Concept of Anxiety (Begrebet Angest)\n(1844) Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844 (Fire opbyggelige Taler)\n(1845) Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions (Tre Taler ved t\u00e6nkte Leiligheder)\n(1845) Stages on Life's Way (Stadier paa Livets Vei)\n(1846) Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments (Afsluttende uvidenskabelig Efterskrift)\n(1847) Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits (Opbyggelige Taler i forskjellig Aand), which included Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing\n(1847) Works of Love (Kjerlighedens Gjerninger)\n(1848) Christian Discourses (Christelige Taler)\n(1848, published 1859) The Point of View of My Work as an Author \"as good as finished\" (IX A 293) ((Synspunktet for min Forfatter-Virksomhed.

Among his best-known works are Moby-Dick (1851), Typee (1846), a romanticized account of his experiences in Polynesia, and Billy Budd, Sailor, a posthumously published novella. Although his reputation was not high at the time of his death, the centennial of his birth in 1919 was the starting point of a Melville revival and Moby-Dick grew to be considered one of the great American novels.\nMelville was born in New York City, the third child of a prosperous merchant whose death in 1832 left the family in financial straits. He took to sea in 1839 as a common sailor on a merchant ship and then on the whaler Acushnet but he jumped ship in the Marquesas Islands. Typee, his first book, and its sequel, Omoo (1847), were travel-adventures based on his encounters with the peoples of the island. Their success gave him the financial security to marry Elizabeth Shaw, the daughter of the Boston jurist Lemuel Shaw. Mardi (1849), a romance-adventure and his first book not based on his own experience, was not well received. Redburn (1849) and White-Jacket (1850), both tales based on his experience as a well-born young man at sea, were given respectable reviews but did not sell well enough to support his expanding family.\nMelville's growing literary ambition showed in Moby-Dick (1851), which took nearly a year and a half to write, but it did not find an audience and critics scorned his psychological novel Pierre: or, The Ambiguities (1852). From 1853 to 1856, Melville published short fiction in magazines, including \"Benito Cereno\" and \"Bartleby, the Scrivener\". In 1857, he traveled to England, toured the Near East, and published his last work of prose, The Confidence-Man (1857). He moved to New York in 1863 to take a position as customs inspector. \nFrom that point, Melville focused his creative powers on poetry. Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866) was his poetic reflection on the moral questions of the American Civil War. In 1867, his eldest child Malcolm died at home from a self-inflicted gunshot. Melville's metaphysical epic Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land was published in 1876. In 1886, his other son Stanwix died of apparent tuberculosis, and Melville retired. During his last years, he privately published two volumes of poetry, and left one volume unpublished. The novella Billy Budd was left unfinished at his death but was published posthumously in 1924. Melville died from cardiovascular disease in 1891.\n\nBiography\nFamily and early life\nHerman Melville was born in New York City on August 1, 1819, to Allan Melvill (1782\u20131832) and Maria (Gansevoort) Melvill (1791\u20131872). Herman was the third of eight children in a family of Dutch heredity and background. His siblings, who played important roles in his career as well as in his emotional life, were Gansevoort (1815\u20131846); Helen Maria (1817\u20131888); Augusta (1821\u20131876); Allan (1823\u20131872); Catherine (1825\u20131905); Frances Priscilla (1827\u20131885); and Thomas (1830\u20131884), who eventually became a governor of Sailors' Snug Harbor. Part of a well-established and colorful Boston family, Allan Melvill spent much time out of New York and in Europe as a commission merchant and an importer of French dry goods.\nBoth of Melville's grandfathers were heroes of the Revolutionary War, and Melville found satisfaction in his \"double revolutionary descent\". Major Thomas Melvill (1751\u20131832) had taken part in the Boston Tea Party, and his maternal grandfather, General Peter Gansevoort (1749\u20131812), was famous for having commanded the defense of Fort Stanwix in New York in 1777. Major Melvill sent his son Allan (Herman's father) to France instead of college at the turn of the 19th century, where he spent two years in Paris and learned to speak and write French fluently. In 1814, Allan, who subscribed to his father's Unitarianism, married Maria Gansevoort, who was committed to the more strict and biblically oriented Dutch Reformed version of the Calvinist creed of her family. This more severe Protestantism of the Gansevoorts' tradition ensured she was well versed in the Bible, both in English as well as in Dutch, the language she had grown up speaking with her parents.On August 19, almost three weeks after his birth, Herman Melville was baptized at home by a minister of the South Reformed Dutch Church. During the 1820s, Melville lived a privileged, opulent life in a household with three or more servants at a time. At four-year intervals, the family would move to more spacious and elegant quarters, finally settling on Broadway in 1828. Allan Melvill lived beyond his means and on large sums he borrowed from both his father and his wife's widowed mother. Although his wife's opinion of his financial conduct is unknown, biographer Hershel Parker suggests Maria \"thought her mother's money was infinite and that she was entitled to much of her portion\" while her children were young. How well the parents managed to hide the truth from their children is \"impossible to know\", according to biographer Andrew Delbanco.In 1830, Maria's family finally lost patience and their support came to a halt, at which point Allan's total debt to both families exceeded $20,000 (equivalent to $480,000 in 2019), showing his lack of financial responsibility. The relative happiness and comfort of Melville's early childhood, biographer Newton Arvin writes, depended not so much on Allan's wealth, or his lack of fiscal prudence, as on the \"exceptionally tender and affectionate spirit in all the family relationships, especially in the immediate circle\". Arvin describes Allan as \"a man of real sensibility and a particularly warm and loving father,\" while Maria was \"warmly maternal, simple, robust, and affectionately devoted to her husband and her brood\".\nA mediocre student\nHerman Melville's education began when he was five and had already been interrupted by age 12. Around the time the Melvills moved to a newly built house at 33 Bleecker Street in Manhattan in 1824, Herman and his older brother Gansevoort were sent to the New York Male High School.  In 1826, the same year that Herman contracted scarlet fever, Allan Melvill described him as \"very backwards in speech & somewhat slow in comprehension\" at first, but his development increased its pace and Allan was surprised \"that Herman proved the best Speaker in the introductory Department\". In 1829, both Gansevoort and Herman were transferred to Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School, and Herman enrolled in the English Department on September 28. \"Herman I think is making more progress than formerly,\" Allan wrote in May 1830 to Major Melvill, \"and without being a bright Scholar, he maintains a respectable standing, and would proceed further, if he could only be induced to study more\u2014being a most amiable and innocent child, I cannot find it in my heart to coerce him\".\nEducation interrupted\nEmotionally unstable and behind on paying the rent for the house on Broadway, Herman's father tried to recover from his setbacks by moving his family to Albany, New York, in 1830 and going into the fur business. Herman attended the Albany Academy from October 1830 to October 1831, where he took the standard preparatory course, studying reading and spelling; penmanship; arithmetic; English grammar; geography; natural history; universal, Greek, Roman and English history; classical biography; and Jewish antiquities. \"The ubiquitous classical references in Melville's published writings,\" as Melville scholar Merton Sealts observed \"suggest that his study of ancient history, biography, and literature during his school days left a lasting impression on both his thought and his art, as did his almost encyclopedic knowledge of both the Old and the New Testaments\". Nonetheless, Melville's time there was brief and his education was soon interrupted. Parker speculates that he left the Academy in October 1831 because \"even the tiny tuition fee seemed too much to pay\". His brothers Gansevoort and Allan continued their attendance a few months longer, Gansevoort until March the next year.In December, Herman's father returned from New York City by steamboat, but ice forced him to travel the last seventy miles over two days and two nights in an open horse carriage at \u22122 degrees Fahrenheit (\u221219 degrees Celsius), causing him to become ill. In early January, he began to show \"signs of delirium\", and his situation grew worse until his wife felt his suffering deprived him of his intellect. Two months before reaching fifty, Allan Melvill died on January 28, 1832. As Herman was no longer attending school, he likely witnessed these scenes. Twenty years later he described a similar death in Pierre.\nWork as a clerk\nThe death of Allan caused many major shifts in the family's material and spiritual circumstances. One result was the greater influence of his mother's religious beliefs. Maria sought consolation in her faith and in April was admitted as a member of the First Reformed Dutch Church. Herman's saturation in orthodox Calvinism was surely the most decisive intellectual and spiritual influence of his early life. \nTwo months after his father's death, Gansevoort entered the cap and fur business. Uncle Peter Gansevoort, a director of the New York State Bank, got Herman a job as clerk for $150 a year (equivalent to $3,800 in 2019). Biographers cite a passage from Redburn when trying to answer what Herman must have felt then: \"I had learned to think much and bitterly before my time,\" the narrator remarks, adding, \"I must not think of those delightful days, before my father became a bankrupt\u00a0... and we removed from the city; for when I think of those days, something rises up in my throat and almost strangles me\". With Melville, Arvin argues, one has to reckon with \"psychology, the tormented psychology, of the decayed patrician\".When Melville's paternal grandfather died on September 16, 1832, Maria and her children discovered Allan, somewhat unscrupulously, had borrowed more than his share of his inheritance, meaning Maria received only $20 (equivalent to $500 in 2019). His paternal grandmother died almost exactly seven months later. Melville did his job well at the bank; although he was only 14 in 1834, the bank considered him competent enough to be sent to Schenectady, New York on an errand. Not much else is known from this period except that he was very fond of drawing. The visual arts became a lifelong interest. Around May 1834, the Melvilles moved to another house in Albany, a three-story brick house. That same month a fire destroyed Gansevoort's skin-preparing factory, which left him with personnel he could neither employ nor afford. Instead he pulled Melville out of the bank to man the cap and fur store.\nIntermittent work and studies\nIn 1835, while still working in the store, Melville enrolled in Albany Classical School, perhaps using Maria's part of the proceeds from the sale of the estate of his maternal grandmother in March 1835. In September of the following year, Herman was back in Albany Academy in the Latin course. He also participated in debating societies, in an apparent effort to make up as much as he could for his missed years of schooling. In this period he read Shakespeare\u2014at least Macbeth, whose witch scenes gave him the chance to teasingly scare his sisters. By March 1837, he was again withdrawn from Albany Academy.\nGansevoort served as a role model and support for Melville throughout his life, particularly during this time trying to cobble together an education. In early 1834 Gansevoort had become a member of Albany's Young Men's Association for Mutual Improvement, and in January 1835 Melville joined him there. Gansevoort also had copies of John Todd's Index Rerum, a blank register for indexing remarkable passages from books one had read for easy retrieval. Among the sample entries which Gansevoort made showing his academic scrupulousness was \"Pequot, beautiful description of the war with,\" with a short title reference to the place in Benjamin Trumbull's A Complete History of Connecticut (Volume I in 1797, and Volume II in 1898) where the description could be found. The two surviving volumes of Gansevoort's are the best evidence for Melville's reading in this period. Gansevoort's entries include books Melville used for Moby-Dick and Clarel, such as \"Parsees\u2014of India\u2014an excellent description of their character, and religion and an account of their descent\u2014East India Sketch Book p. 21\". Other entries are on Panther, the pirate's cabin, and storm at sea from James Fenimore Cooper's The Red Rover, Saint-Saba.\nWork as a school teacher\nThe Panic of 1837 forced Gansevoort to file for bankruptcy in April. In June, Maria told the younger children they needed to leave Albany for somewhere cheaper. Gansevoort began studying law in New York City while Herman managed the farm before getting a teaching position at Sikes District School near Lenox, Massachusetts. He taught about 30 students of various ages, including some his own age.The semester over, he returned to his mother in 1838. In February he was elected president of the Philo Logos Society, which Peter Gansevoort invited to move into Stanwix Hall for no rent. In the Albany Microscope in March, Melville published two polemical letters about issues in vogue in the debating societies. Historians Leon Howard and Hershel Parker suggest the motive behind the letters was a youthful desire to have his rhetorical skills publicly recognized. In May, the Melvilles moved to a rented house in Lansingburgh, almost 12 miles north of Albany. Nothing is known about what Melville did or where he went for several months after he finished teaching at Sikes. On November 12, five days after arriving in Lansingburgh, Melville paid for a term at Lansingburgh Academy to study surveying and engineering. In an April 1839 letter recommending Herman for a job in the Engineer Department of the Erie Canal, Peter Gansevoort says his nephew \"possesses the ambition to make himself useful in a business which he desires to make his profession,\" but no job resulted.Just weeks after this failure, Melville's first known published essay appeared. Using the initials \"L.A.V\"., Herman contributed \"Fragments from a Writing Desk\" to the weekly newspaper Democratic Press and Lansingburgh Advertiser, which printed it in two installments, the first on May 4. According to Merton Sealts, his use of heavy-handed allusions reveals familiarity with the work of William Shakespeare, John Milton, Walter Scott, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Edmund Burke, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, and Thomas Moore. Parker calls the piece \"characteristic Melvillean mood-stuff\" and considers its style \"excessive enough [...] to indulge his extravagances and just enough overdone to allow him to deny that he was taking his style seriously\". For Delbanco, the style is \"overheated in the manner of Poe, with sexually charged echoes of Byron and The Arabian Nights\".\n1839\u20131844: Years at sea\nOn May 31, 1839, Gansevoort, then living in New York City, wrote that he was sure Herman could get a job on a whaler or merchant vessel. The next day, he signed aboard the merchant ship St. Lawrence as a \"boy\" (a green hand), which cruised from New York to Liverpool. Redburn: His First Voyage (1849) draws on his experiences in this journey; at least two of the nine guide-books listed in chapter 30 of the book had been part of Allan Melville's library. He arrived back in New York October 1, 1839 and resumed teaching, now at Greenbush, New York, but left after one term because he had not been paid. In the summer of 1840 he and his friend James Murdock Fly went to Galena, Illinois to see if his Uncle Thomas could help them find work. Unsuccessful, he and his friend returned home in autumn, likely by way of St. Louis and up the Ohio River.As part of the response to contemporaneous popular cultural reading, including Richard Henry Dana Jr.'s new book Two Years Before the Mast, and by Jeremiah N. Reynolds's account in the May 1839 issue of The Knickerbocker magazine of the hunt for a great white sperm whale named Mocha Dick, Melville and Gansevoort traveled to New Bedford, where Melville signed up for a whaling voyage aboard a new ship, the Acushnet. Built in 1840, the ship measured some 104 feet in length, almost 28 feet in breadth, and almost 14 feet in depth. She measured slightly less than 360 tons, had two decks and three masts, but no quarter galleries. The Acushnet was owned by Melvin O. Bradford and Philemon Fuller of Fairhaven, Massachusetts and was berth near their office at the foot of Center Street in that town. Melville signed a contract on Christmas Day with the ship's agent as a \"green hand\" for 1\/175th of whatever profits the voyage would yield. On Sunday the 27th the brothers heard the Reverend Enoch Mudge preach at the Seamen's Bethel on Johnny-Cake Hill, where white marble cenotaphs on the walls memorialized local sailors who had died at sea, often in battle with whales. When he signed the crew list the next day he was advanced $84.On January 3, 1841, the Acushnet set sail. Melville slept with some twenty others in the forecastle; Captain Valentine Pease, the mates, and the skilled men slept aft. Whales were found near The Bahamas, and in March 150 barrels of oil were sent home from Rio de Janeiro. Cutting in and trying-out (boiling) a single whale took about three days, and a whale yielded approximately one barrel of oil per foot of length and per ton of weight (the average whale weighed 40 to 60 tons). The oil was kept on deck for a day to cool off, and was then stowed down; scrubbing the deck completed the labor. An average voyage meant that some forty whales were killed to yield some 1600 barrels of oil.On April 15, the Acushnet sailed around Cape Horn, and traveled to the South Pacific, where the crew sighted whales without catching any. Then up the coast of Chile to the region of Selkirk Island and on May 7, near Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, she had 160 barrels. On June 23 the ship anchored for the first time since Rio, in Santa Harbor. The cruising grounds the Acushnet was sailing attracted much traffic, and Captain Pease not only paused to visit other whalers, but at times hunted in company with them. From July 23 into August the Acushnet regularly gammed with the Lima from Nantucket, and Melville met William Henry Chase, the son of Owen Chase, who gave him a copy of his father's account of his adventures aboard the Essex. Ten years later Melville wrote in his other copy of the book: \"The reading of this wondrous story upon the landless sea, & close to the very latitude of the shipwreck had a surprising effect upon me\".\nOn September 25 the ship reported 600 barrels of oil to another whaler, and in October 700 barrels. On October 24 the Acushnet crossed the equator to the north, and six or seven days later arrived at the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. This short visit would be the basis for The Encantadas. On November 2, the Acushnet and three other American whalers were hunting together near the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands; Melville later exaggerated that number in Sketch Fourth of The Encantadas. From November 19 to 25 the ship anchored at Chatham's Isle, and on December 2 reached the coast of Peru and anchored at Tombez near Paita, with 570 barrels of oil on board. On December 27 the Acushnet sighted Cape Blanco, off Ecuador, Point St. Elena was sighted the next day, and on January 6, 1842, the ship approached the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands from the southeast. From February May 13 to 7, seven sightings of sperm whales were recorded but none killed. From early May to early June, the Acushnet cooperatively set about its whaling endeavors several times with the Columbus of New Bedford, which also took letters from Melville's ship; the two ships were in the same area just south of the Equator. On June 16 she carried 750 barrels, and sent home 200 on the Herald the Second. On June 23, the Acushnet reached the Marquesas Islands, and anchored at Nuku Hiva. \nIn the summer of 1842, Melville and his shipmate Richard Tobias Greene (\"Toby\") jumped ship at Nuku Hiva Bay. Melville's first book, Typee (1846), is based on his stay in or near the Taipi Valley. By around mid-August, Melville had left the island aboard the Australian whaler Lucy Ann, bound for Tahiti, where on arrival he took part in a mutiny and was briefly jailed in the native Calabooza Beretanee. In October, he and crew mate John B. Troy escaped Tahiti for Eimeo. He then spent a month as beachcomber and island rover (\"omoo\" in Tahitian), eventually crossing over to Moorea. He drew on these experiences for Omoo, the sequel to Typee. In November, he contracted to be a seaman on the Nantucket whaler Charles & Henry for a six-month cruise (November 1842\u00a0\u2212 April 1843), and was discharged at Lahaina, Maui in the Hawaiian Islands in May 1843.After four months of working several jobs, including as a clerk, he joined the US Navy initially as one of the crew of the frigate USS\u00a0United States as an ordinary seaman on August 20. During the next year, the homeward bound ship visited the Marquesas Islands, Tahiti, and Valparaiso, and then, from summer to fall 1844, Mazatlan, Lima, and Rio de Janeiro, before reaching Boston on October 3. Melville was discharged on October 14. This Navy experience is used in White-Jacket (1850), Melville's fifth book. Melville's wander-years created what biographer Arvin calls \"a settled hatred of external authority, a lust for personal freedom\" and a \"growing and intensifying sense of his own exceptionalism as a person,\" along with \"the resentful sense that circumstance and mankind together had already imposed their will upon him in a series of injurious ways\". Scholar Robert Milder believes the encounter with the wide ocean, where he was seemingly abandoned by God, led Melville to experience a \"metaphysical estrangement\" and influenced his social views in two ways: first, that he belonged to the genteel classes but sympathized with the \"disinherited commons\" he had been placed among; and second that experiencing the cultures of Polynesia let him view the West from an outsider's perspective.\n1845\u20131850: Successful writer\nUpon his return, Melville regaled his family and friends with his adventurous tales and romantic experiences, and they urged him to put them into writing. Melville completed Typee, his first book, in the summer of 1845 while living in Troy, New York. His brother Gansevoort found a publisher for it in London, where it was published in February 1846 by John Murray in his travel adventure series. It became an overnight bestseller in England, then in New York, when it was published on March 17 by Wiley & Putnam.In the narrative, Melville likely extended the period of time he had spent on the island and also incorporated material from source books he had assembled. Milder calls Typee \"an appealing mixture of adventure, anecdote, ethnography, and social criticism presented with a genial latitudinarianism that gave novelty to a South Sea idyll at once erotically suggestive and romantically chaste\".\nAn unsigned review in the Salem Advertiser written by Nathaniel Hawthorne called the book a \"skilfully managed\" narrative by an author with \"that freedom of view\u00a0... which renders him tolerant of codes of morals that may be little in accordance with our own\". Hawthorne continued: This book is lightly but vigorously written; and we are acquainted with no work that gives a freer and more effective picture of barbarian life, in that unadulterated state of which there are now so few specimens remaining. The gentleness of disposition that seems akin to the delicious climate, is shown in contrast with the traits of savage fierceness...He has that freedom of view\u2014it would be too harsh to call it laxity of principle\u2014which renders him tolerant of codes of morals that may be little in accordance with our own, a spirit proper enough to a young and adventurous sailor, and which makes his book the more wholesome to our staid landsmen. \nPleased but not overwhelmed by the adulation of his new public, Melville later expressed concern that he would \"go down to posterity ... as a 'man who lived among the cannibals'!\" The writing of Typee brought Melville back into contact with his friend Greene\u2014Toby in the book\u2014who wrote confirming Melville's account in newspapers. The two corresponded until 1863, and in his final years Melville \"traced and successfully located his old friend\" for a further meeting of the two. In March 1847, Omoo, a sequel to Typee was published by Murray in London, and in May by Harper in New York. Omoo is \"a slighter but more professional book,\" according to Milder. Typee and Omoo gave Melville overnight renown as a writer and adventurer, and he often entertained by telling stories to his admirers. As the writer and editor Nathaniel Parker Willis wrote, \"With his cigar and his Spanish eyes, he talks Typee and Omoo, just as you find the flow of his delightful mind on paper\". In 1847 Melville tried unsuccessfully to find a \"government job\" in Washington.\nIn June 1847, Melville and Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Knapp Shaw were engaged, after knowing each other for approximately three months. Melville had first asked her father, Lemuel Shaw, for her hand in March, but was turned down at the time. Shaw, Chief Justice of Massachusetts, had been a close friend of Melville's father, and his marriage with Melville's aunt Nancy was prevented only by her death. His warmth and financial support for the family continued after Allan's death. Melville dedicated his first book, Typee, to him.  Lizzie was raised by her grandmother and an Irish nurse. Arvin suggests that Melville's interest in Lizzie may have been stimulated by \"his need of Judge Shaw's paternal presence\". They were married on August 4, 1847. Lizzie described their marriage as \"very unexpected, and scarcely thought of until about two months before it actually took place\". She wanted to be married in church, but they had a private wedding ceremony at home to avoid possible crowds hoping to see the celebrity. The couple honeymooned in the then-British Province of Canada, and traveled to Montreal. They settled in a house on Fourth Avenue in New York City (now called Park Avenue).\nAccording to scholars Joyce Deveau Kennedy and Frederick James Kennedy, Lizzie brought to their marriage a sense of religious obligation, an intent to make a home with Melville regardless of place, a willingness to please her husband by performing such \"tasks of drudgery\" as mending stockings, an ability to hide her agitation, and a desire \"to shield Melville from unpleasantness\". The Kennedys conclude their assessment with:\n\nIf the ensuing years did bring regrets to Melville's life, it is impossible to believe he would have regretted marrying Elizabeth. In fact, he must have realized that he could not have borne the weight of those years unaided\u2014that without her loyalty, intelligence, and affection, his own wild imagination would have had no \"port or haven\".\nBiographer Robertson-Lorant cites \"Lizzie's adventurous spirit and abundant energy,\" and she suggests that \"her pluck and good humor might have been what attracted Melville to her, and vice versa\". An example of such good humor appears in a letter about her not yet used to being married: \"It seems sometimes exactly as if I were here for a visit. The illusion is quite dispelled however when Herman stalks into my room without even the ceremony of knocking, bringing me perhaps a button to sew on, or some equally romantic occupation\". On February 16, 1849, the Melvilles' first child, Malcolm, was born.In March 1848, Mardi was published by Richard Bentley in London, and in April by Harper in New York. Nathaniel Hawthorne thought it a rich book \"with depths here and there that compel a man to swim for his life\". According to Milder, the book began as another South Sea story but, as he wrote, Melville left that genre behind, first in favor of \"a romance of the narrator Taji and the lost maiden Yillah,\" and then \"to an allegorical voyage of the philosopher Babbalanja and his companions through the imaginary archipelago of Mardi\".In October 1849, Redburn was published by Bentley in London, and in November by Harper in New York. The bankruptcy and death of Allan Melvill, and Melville's own youthful humiliations surface in this \"story of outward adaptation and inner impairment\". Biographer Robertson-Lorant regards the work as a deliberate attempt for popular appeal: \"Melville modeled each episode almost systematically on every genre that was popular with some group of antebellum readers,\" combining elements of \"the picaresque novel, the travelogue, the nautical adventure, the sentimental novel, the sensational French romance, the gothic thriller, temperance tracts, urban reform literature, and the English pastoral\". His next novel, White-Jacket, was published by Bentley in London in January 1850, and in March by Harper in New York.\n1850\u20131851: Hawthorne and Moby-Dick\nThe earliest surviving mention of Moby-Dick is from a May 1, 1850 letter in which Melville told fellow sea author Richard Henry Dana Jr. \u2033I am half way in the work.\u2033 In June, he described the book to his English publisher as \"a romance of adventure, founded upon certain wild legends in the Southern Sperm Whale Fisheries,\" and promised it would be done by the fall. The original manuscript has not survived, but over the next several months Melville radically transformed his initial plan, conceiving what Delbanco described in 2005 as \"the most ambitious book ever conceived by an American writer\".From August 4 to 12, 1850, the Melvilles, Sarah Morewood, Evert Duyckinck, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and other literary figures from New York and Boston came to Pittsfield to enjoy a period of parties, picnics, dinners, and the like. Nathaniel Hawthorne and his publisher James T. Fields joined the group while Hawthorne's wife stayed at home to look after the children. Melville wrote that these stories revealed a dark side to Hawthorne, \"shrouded in blackness, ten times black\". Later that summer, Duyckinck sent Hawthorne copies of Melville's three latest books. Hawthorne read them, as he wrote to Duyckinck on August 29, \"with a progressive appreciation of their author\". He thought Melville in Redburn and White-Jacket put the reality \"more unflinchingly\" before his reader than any writer, and he thought Mardi was \"a rich book, with depths here and there that compel a man to swim for his life. It is so good that one scarcely pardons the writer for not having brooded long over it, so as to make it a great deal better\".In September 1850, Melville borrowed three thousand dollars from his father-in-law Lemuel Shaw to buy a 160-acre farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Melville called his new home Arrowhead because of the arrowheads that were dug up around the property during planting season. That winter, Melville paid Hawthorne an unexpected visit, only to discover he was working and \"not in the mood for company\". Hawthorne's wife Sophia gave him copies of Twice-Told Tales and, for Malcolm, The Grandfather's Chair. Melville invited them to visit Arrowhead soon, hoping to \"[discuss] the Universe with a bottle of brandy & cigars\" with Hawthorne, but Hawthorne would not stop working on his new book for more than one day and they did not come. After a second visit from Melville, Hawthorne surprised him by arriving at Arrowhead with his daughter Una. According to Robertson-Lorant, \"The handsome Hawthorne made quite an impression on the Melville women, especially Augusta, who was a great fan of his books\". They spent the day mostly \"smoking and talking metaphysics\".\nIn Robertson-Lorant's assessment of the friendship, Melville was \"infatuated with Hawthorne's intellect, captivated by his artistry, and charmed by his elusive personality,\" and though the two writers were \"drawn together in an undeniable sympathy of soul and intellect, the friendship meant something different to each of them,\" with Hawthorne offering Melville \"the kind of intellectual stimulation he needed\". They may have been \"natural allies and friends,\" yet they were also \"fifteen years apart in age and temperamentally quite different\" and Hawthorne \"found Melville's manic intensity exhausting at times\". Melville wrote 10 letters to Hawthorne; one scholar identifies \"sexual excitement...in all the letters\". Melville was inspired and with Hawthorne during the period that he was writing Moby-Dick. Melville dedicated the work to Hawthorne: \"In token of my admiration for his genius, this book is inscribed to Nathaniel Hawthorne\".\nOn October 18, 1851, The Whale was published in Britain in three volumes, and on November 14 Moby-Dick appeared in the United States as a single volume. In between these dates, on October 22, 1851, the Melvilles' second child, Stanwix, was born. In December, Hawthorne told Duyckinck, \"What a book Melville has written! It gives me an idea of much greater power than his preceding ones.\" Unlike other contemporaneous reviewers of Melville, Hawthorne had seen the uniqueness of Melville's new novel and acknowledged it. In early December 1852, Melville visited the Hawthornes in Concord and discussed the idea of the \"Agatha\" story he had pitched to Hawthorne. This was the last known contact between the two writers before Melville visited Hawthorne in Liverpool four years later when Hawthorne had relocated to England.\n1852\u20131857: Unsuccessful writer\n\nAfter having borrowed three thousand dollars from his father-in-law in September 1850 to buy a 160-acre farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Melville had high hopes that his next book would please the public and restore his finances. In April 1851 he told his British publisher, Richard Bentley, that his new book had \"unquestionable novelty\" and was calculated to have wide appeal with elements of romance and mystery. In fact, Pierre: or, The Ambiguities was heavily psychological, though drawing on the conventions of the romance, and difficult in style. It was not well received. The New York Day Book published a venomous attack on September 8, 1852, headlined \"HERMAN MELVILLE CRAZY\". The item, offered as a news story, reported, A critical friend, who read Melville's last book, Ambiguities, between two steamboat accidents, told us that it appeared to be composed of the ravings and reveries of a madman. We were somewhat startled at the remark, but still more at learning, a few days after, that Melville was really supposed to be deranged, and that his friends were taking measures to place him under treatment. We hope one of the earliest precautions will be to keep him stringently secluded from pen and ink. \nOn May 22, 1853, Melville's third child and first daughter Elizabeth (Bessie) was born, and on or about that day Herman finished work on the Agatha story, Isle of the Cross. Melville traveled to New York to discuss a book, presumably Isle of the Cross, with his publisher, but later wrote that Harper & Brothers was \"prevented\" from publishing his manuscript because it was lost.After the commercial and critical failure of Pierre, Melville had difficulty finding a publisher for his follow-up novel Israel Potter. Instead, this narrative of a Revolutionary War veteran was serialized in Putnam's Monthly Magazine in 1853. From November 1853 to 1856, Melville published fourteen tales and sketches in Putnam's and Harper's magazines. In December 1855 he proposed to Dix & Edwards, the new owners of Putnam's, that they publish a selective collection of the short fiction. The collection, titled The Piazza Tales, was named after a new introductory story Melville wrote for it, \"The Piazza\". It also contained five previously published stories, including \"Bartleby, the Scrivener\" and \"Benito Cereno\". On March 2, 1855, the Melvilles' fourth child, Frances (Fanny), was born. In this period, his book Israel Potter was published.\nThe writing of The Confidence-Man put great strain on Melville, leading Sam Shaw, a nephew of Lizzie, to write to his uncle Lemuel Shaw: \"Herman I hope has had no more of those ugly attacks\"\u2014a reference to what Robertson-Lorant calls \"the bouts of rheumatism and sciatica that plagued Melville\". Melville's father-in-law apparently shared his daughter's \"great anxiety about him\" when he wrote a letter to a cousin, in which he described Melville's working habits: \"When he is deeply engaged in one of his literary works, he confines him[self] to hard study many hours in the day, with little or no exercise, and this specially in winter for a great many days together. He probably thus overworks himself and brings on severe nervous affections\". Shaw advanced Melville $1,500 from Lizzie's inheritance to travel four or five months in Europe and the Holy Land.From October 11, 1856, to May 20, 1857, Melville made a six-month Grand Tour of Europe and the Mediterranean. While in England, in November 1856, he briefly reunited for three days with Hawthorne, who had taken the position of United States Consul at Liverpool, at that time the hub of Britain's Atlantic trade. At the nearby coast resort of Southport, amid the sand dunes where they had stopped to smoke cigars, they had a conversation which Hawthorne later described in his journal: \"Melville, as he always does, began to reason of Providence and futurity, and of everything that lies beyond human ken, and informed me that he 'pretty much made up his mind to be annihilated' [...] If he were a religious man, he would be one of the most truly religious and reverential; he has a very high and noble nature, and better worth immortality than most of us.\"The Mediterranean part of the tour took in the Holy Land, which inspired his epic poem Clarel. On April 1, 1857, Melville published his last full-length novel The Confidence-Man. This novel, subtitled His Masquerade, has won general acclaim in modern times as a complex and mysterious exploration of issues of fraud and honesty, identity and masquerade. However, when it was published, it received reviews ranging from the bewildered to the denunciatory.\n1857\u20131876: Poet\nTo repair his faltering finances, Melville took up public lecturing from late 1857 to 1860. He embarked upon three lecture tours and spoke at lyceums, chiefly on Roman statuary and sightseeing in Rome. Melville's lectures, which mocked the pseudo-intellectualism of lyceum culture, were panned by contemporary audiences. On May 30, 1860, Melville boarded the clipper Meteor for California, with his brother Thomas at the helm. After a shaky trip around Cape Horn, Melville returned to New York alone via Panama in November. Later that year, he submitted a poetry collection to a publisher but it was not accepted, and is now lost. In 1863, he bought his brother's house at 104 East 26th Street in New York City and moved there.In 1864, Melville visited the Virginia battlefields of the American Civil War. After the war, he published Battle Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866), a collection of 72 poems that has been described as \"a polyphonic verse journal of the conflict\". The work did not do well commercially\u2014of the print run of 1,260 copies, 300 were sent as review copies, and 551 copies were sold\u2014and reviewers did not realize that Melville had purposely avoided the ostentatious diction and fine writing that were in fashion, choosing to be concise and spare.In 1866, Melville became a customs inspector for New York City. He held the post for 19 years and had a reputation for honesty in a notoriously corrupt institution. Unbeknownst to him, his position was sometimes protected by Chester A. Arthur, at that time a customs official who admired Melville's writing but never spoke to him. During this time, Melville was short-tempered because of nervous exhaustion, physical pain, and drinking. He would sometimes mistreat his family and servants in his unpredictable mood swings. Robertson-Lorant compared Melville's behavior to the \"tyrannical captains he had portrayed in his novels\".In 1867, his oldest son died at home at the age of 18 from a self-inflicted gun shot. Historians and psychologists disagree on if it was intentional or accidental. In May 1867, Lizzie's brother plotted to help her leave Melville without suffering the consequences divorce carried at the time, particularly the loss of all claim to her children. His plan was for Lizzie to visit Boston, and friends would inform Melville she would not come back. To get a divorce, she would then have to bring charges against Melville, asserting her husband to be insane, but she ultimately decided against pursuing a divorce.Though Melville's professional writing career had ended, he remained dedicated to his writing. He spent years on what Milder called \"his autumnal masterpiece\" Clarel: A Poem and a Pilgrimage (1876), an 18,000-line epic poem inspired by his 1856 trip to the Holy Land. It is among the longest single poems in American literature. The title character is a young American student of divinity who travels to Jerusalem to renew his faith. One of the central characters, Rolfe, is similar to Melville in his younger days, a seeker and adventurer, while the reclusive Vine is loosely based on Hawthorne, who had died twelve years before. Publication of 350 copies was funded with a bequest from his uncle in 1876, but sales failed miserably and the unsold copies were burned when Melville was unable to buy them at cost. Critic Lewis Mumford found an unread copy in the New York Public Library in 1925 \"with its pages uncut\".\n1877\u20131891: Final years\nAlthough Melville's own finances remained limited, in 1884, Lizzie received a legacy that enabled him to buy a steady stream of books and prints each month. Melville retired on December 31, 1885, after several of his wife's relatives further supported the couple with supplementary legacies and inheritances. On February 22, 1886, Stanwix Melville died in San Francisco at age 36, apparently from tuberculosis. In 1889, Melville became a member of the New York Society Library.Melville had a modest revival of popularity in England when readers rediscovered his novels in the late 19th century. A series of poems inspired by his early experiences at sea, with prose head notes, were published in two collections for his relatives and friends, each with a print run of 25 copies. The first, John Marr and Other Sailors, was published in 1888, followed by Timoleon in 1891.\n\nHe died the morning of September 28, 1891. His death certificate shows \"cardiac dilation\" as the cause. He was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City. The New York Times's obituary mistakenly called his masterpiece \"Mobie Dick\", erroneously implying that he and his books were unappreciated at his time of death. A later article was published on October 6 in the same paper, referring to him as \"the late Hiram Melville\", but this appears to have been a typesetting error.Melville left a volume of poetry, Weeds and Wildings, and a sketch, \"Daniel Orme\", unpublished at the time of his death. His wife also found pages for an unfinished novella, titled Billy Budd. Melville had revised and rearranged the manuscript in several stages, leaving the pages in disarray. Lizzie could not decide her husband's intentions (or even read his handwriting in some places) and abandoned attempts to edit the manuscript for publication. The pages were stored in a family breadbox until 1919 when Melville's granddaughter gave them to Raymond Weaver. Weaver, who initially dismissed the work's importance, published a quick transcription in 1924. This version, however, contained many misreadings, some of which affected interpretation. It was an immediate critical success in England, then in the United States. In 1962, the Melville scholars Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts published a critical reading text that was widely accepted. It was adapted as a stage play on Broadway in 1951, then an opera, and in 1961 as a film.\nWriting style\nGeneral narrative style\nMelville's writing style shows both consistencies and enormous changes throughout the years. His development \"had been abnormally postponed, and when it came, it came with a rush and a force that had the menace of quick exhaustion in it\". As early as \"Fragments from a Writing Desk\", written when Melville was 20, scholar Sealts sees \"a number of elements that anticipate Melville's later writing, especially his characteristic habit of abundant literary allusion\". Typee and Omoo were documentary adventures that called for a division of the narrative in short chapters. Such compact organization bears the risk of fragmentation when applied to a lengthy work such as Mardi, but with Redburn and White Jacket, Melville turned the short chapter into a concentrated narrative.Some chapters of Moby-Dick are no more than two pages in standard editions, and an extreme example is Chapter 122, consisting of a single paragraph of 36 words. The skillful handling of chapters in Moby-Dick is one of the most fully developed Melvillean signatures, and is a measure of his masterly writing style. Individual chapters have become \"a touchstone for appreciation of Melville's art and for explanation\" of his themes. In contrast, the chapters in Pierre, called Books, are divided into short-numbered sections, seemingly an \"odd formal compromise\" between Melville's natural length and his purpose to write a regular romance that called for longer chapters. As satirical elements were introduced, the chapter arrangement restores \"some degree of organization and pace from the chaos\". The usual chapter unit then reappears for Israel Potter, The Confidence-Man and even Clarel, but only becomes \"a vital part in the whole creative achievement\" again in the juxtaposition of accents and of topics in Billy Budd.Newton Arvin points out that only superficially the books after Mardi seem as if Melville's writing went back to the vein of his first two books. In reality, his movement \"was not a retrograde but a spiral one\", and while Redburn and White Jacket may lack the spontaneous, youthful charm of his first two books, they are \"denser in substance, richer in feeling, tauter, more complex, more connotative in texture and imagery\". The rhythm of the prose in Omoo \"achieves little more than easiness; the language is almost neutral and without idiosyncrasy\", while Redburn shows an improved ability in narrative which fuses imagery and emotion.Melville's early works were \"increasingly baroque\" in style, and with Moby-Dick Melville's vocabulary had grown superabundant. Walter Bezanson calls it an \"immensely varied style\". According to critic Warner Berthoff, three characteristic uses of language can be recognized. First, the exaggerated repetition of words, as in the series \"pitiable\", \"pity\", \"pitied\", and \"piteous\" (Ch. 81, \"The Pequod Meets the Virgin\"). A second typical device is the use of unusual adjective-noun combinations, as in \"concentrating brow\" and \"immaculate manliness\" (Ch. 26, \"Knights and Squires\"). A third characteristic is the presence of a participial modifier to emphasize and to reinforce the already established expectations of the reader, as the words \"preluding\" and \"foreshadowing\" (\"so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene\u00a0...\" \"In this foreshadowing interval\u00a0...\").\nAfter his use of hyphenated compounds in Pierre, Melville's writing gives Berthoff the impression of becoming less exploratory and less provocative in his choices of words and phrases. Instead of providing a lead \"into possible meanings and openings-out of the material in hand,\" the vocabulary now served \"to crystallize governing impressions,\" the diction no longer attracted attention to itself, except as an effort at exact definition. The language, Berthoff continues, reflects a \"controlling intelligence, of right judgment and completed understanding\". The sense of free inquiry and exploration which infused his earlier writing and accounted for its \"rare force and expansiveness,\" tended to give way to \"static enumeration\". By comparison to the verbal music and kinetic energy of Moby-Dick, Melville's subsequent writings seem \"relatively muted, even withheld\" in his later works.Melville's paragraphing in his best work Berthoff considers to be the virtuous result of \"compactness of form and free assembling of unanticipated further data\", such as when the mysterious sperm whale is compared with Exodus's invisibility of God's face in the final paragraph of Chapter 86 (\"The Tail\"). Over time Melville's paragraphs became shorter as his sentences grew longer, until he arrived at the \"one-sentence paragraphing characteristic of his later prose\". Berthoff points to the opening chapter of The Confidence-Man for an example, as it counts fifteen paragraphs, seven of which consist of only one elaborate sentence, and four that have only two sentences. The use of similar technique in Billy Budd contributes in large part, Berthoff says, to its \"remarkable narrative economy\".\nStyle and literary allusion\nIn Nathalia Wright's view, Melville's sentences generally have a looseness of structure, easy to use for devices as catalogue and allusion, parallel and refrain, proverb and allegory. The length of his clauses may vary greatly, but the narrative style of writing in Pierre and The Confidence-Man is there to convey feeling, not thought. Unlike Henry James, who was an innovator of sentence ordering to render the subtlest nuances in thought, Melville made few such innovations. His domain is the mainstream of English prose, with its rhythm and simplicity influenced by the King James Bible. Another important characteristic of Melville's writing style is in its echoes and overtones. Melville's imitation of certain distinct styles is responsible for this. His three most important sources, in order, are the Bible, Shakespeare, and Milton. Direct quotation from any of the sources is slight; only one sixth of his Biblical allusions can be qualified as such because Melville adapts Biblical usage to his own narrated textual requirements of clarifying his plot.The Biblical elements in Melville's style can be divided into three categories. In the first, allusion is more within the narrative rather than formal quotation. Several preferred Biblical allusions appear repeatedly throughout his body of work, taking on the nature of refrains. Examples are the injunctions to be 'as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves,' 'death on a pale horse,' 'the man of sorrows', the 'many mansions of heaven;' proverbs 'as the hairs on our heads are numbered,' 'pride goes before a fall,' 'the wages of sin is death;' adverbs and pronouns as 'verily, whoso, forasmuch as; phrases as come to pass, children's children, the fat of the land, vanity of vanities, outer darkness, the apple of his eye, Ancient of Days, the rose of Sharon.' Second, there are paraphrases of individual and combined verses. Redburn's \"Thou shalt not lay stripes upon these Roman citizens\" makes use of language of the Ten Commandments in Ex.20 and Pierre's inquiry of Lucy: \"Loveth she me with the love past all understanding?\" combines John 21:15\u201317, and Philippians 4:7. Third, certain Hebraisms are used, such as a succession of genitives (\"all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob\"), the cognate accusative (\"I dreamed a dream\", \"Liverpool was created with the Creation\"), and the parallel (\"Closer home does it go than a rammer; and fighting with steel is a play without ever an interlude\"). This passage from Redburn shows how these ways of alluding interlock and result in a texture of Biblical language though there is very little direct quotation:\n\nThe other world beyond this, which was longed for by the devout before Columbus' time, was found in the New; and the deep-sea land, that first struck these soundings, brought up the soil of Earth's Paradise. Not a Paradise then, or now; but to be made so at God's good pleasure, and in the fulness and mellowness of time. The seed is sown, and the harvest must come; and our children's children, on the world's jubilee morning, shall all go with their sickles to the reaping. Then shall the curse of Babel be revoked, a new Pentecost come, and the language they shall speak shall be the language of Britain. Frenchmen, and Danes, and Scots; and the dwellers on the shores of the Mediterranean, and in the regions round about; Italians, and Indians, and Moors; there shall appear unto them cloven tongues as of fire.\nIn addition to this, Melville successfully imitates three Biblical strains: the apocalyptic, the prophetic and the sermonic narrative tone of writing. Melville sustains the apocalyptic tone of anxiety and foreboding for a whole chapter of Mardi. The prophetic strain is expressed by Melville in Moby-Dick, most notably in Father Mapple's sermon. The tradition of the Psalms is imitated at length by Melville in The Confidence-Man.In 1849, Melville acquired an edition of Shakespeare's works printed in a font large enough for his tired eyes, which led to a deeper study of Shakespeare that greatly influenced the style of his next book, Moby-Dick (1851). The critic F.\u00a0O. Matthiessen found that the language of Shakespeare far surpasses other influences upon the book, in that it inspired Melville to discover his own full strength. On almost every page, debts to Shakespeare can be discovered. The \"mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing\" at the end of \"Cetology\" (Ch. 32) echo the famous phrase in Macbeth: \"Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury\/ Signifying nothing\". Ahab's first extended speech to the crew, in the \"Quarter-Deck\" (Ch. 36) is practically blank verse and so is Ahab's soliloquy at the beginning of \"Sunset\" (Ch. 37):'I leave a white and turbid wake;\/ Pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er I sail.\/ The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm\/ My track; let them; but first I pass.' Through Shakespeare, Melville infused Moby-Dick with a power of expression he had not previously expressed. Reading Shakespeare had been \"a catalytic agent\" for Melville, one that transformed his writing from merely reporting to \"the expression of profound natural forces\". The extent to which Melville assimilated Shakespeare is evident in the description of Ahab, Matthiessen continues, which ends in language that seems Shakespearean yet is no imitation: 'Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!' The imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly Shakespearean, \"but its two key words appear only once each in the plays...and to neither of these usages is Melville indebted for his fresh combination\". Melville's diction depended upon no source, and his prose is not based on anybody else's verse but on an awareness of \"speech rhythm\".Melville's mastering of Shakespeare, Matthiessen finds, supplied him with verbal resources that enabled him to create dramatic language through three essential techniques. First, the use of verbs of action creates a sense of movement and meaning. The effective tension caused by the contrast of \"thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds\" and \"there's that in here that still remains indifferent\" in \"The Candles\" (Ch. 119) makes the last clause lead to a \"compulsion to strike the breast,\" which suggests \"how thoroughly the drama has come to inhere in the words;\" Second, Melville took advantage of the Shakespearean energy of verbal compounds, as in \"full-freighted\". Third, Melville employed the device of making one part of speech act as another, for example, 'earthquake' as an adjective, or turning an adjective into a noun, as in \"placeless\".Melville's style, in Nathalia Wright's analysis, seamlessly flows over into theme, because all these borrowings have an artistic purpose, which is to suggest an appearance \"larger and more significant than life\" for characters and themes that are in fact unremarkable. The allusions suggest that beyond the world of appearances another world exists, one that influences this world, and where ultimate truth can be found. Moreover, the ancient background thus suggested for Melville's narratives\u00a0\u2013\u00a0ancient allusions being next in number to the Biblical ones\u00a0\u2013\u00a0invests them with a sense of timelessness.\nCritical reception\nMelville was not financially successful as a writer; over his entire lifetime Melville's writings earned him just over $10,000 (equivalent to $240,094 in 2019). Melville's travelogues based on voyages to the South Seas and stories based on his time in the merchant marine and navy led to some initial success, but his popularity declined dramatically afterwards. By 1876, all of his books were out of print. He was viewed as a minor figure in American literature in the later years of his life and during the years immediately after his death.\nPoetry\nMelville did not publish poetry until his late thirties, with Battle-Pieces (1866) and did not receive recognition as a poet until well into the 20th century. But he wrote predominantly poetry for about 25 years, twice as long as his prose career. The three novels of the 1850s that Melville worked on most seriously to present his philosophical explorations, Moby-Dick, Pierre, and The Confidence Man, seem to make the step to philosophical poetry a natural one rather than simply a consequence of commercial failure. Since he turned to poetry as a meditative practice, his poetic style, even more than most Victorian poets, was not marked by linguistic play or melodic considerations.Early critics were not sympathetic. Henry Chapin, in his introduction to John Marr and Other Poems (1922), one of the earlier selections of Melville's poetry, said Melville's verse is \"of an amateurish and uneven quality\" but in it \"that loveable freshness of personality, which his philosophical dejection never quenched, is everywhere in evidence,\" in \"the voice of a true poet\".  The poet and novelist Robert Penn Warren became a champion of Melville as a great American poet and issued a selection of Melville's poetry in 1971 prefaced by an admiring critical essay. In the 1990s critic Lawrence Buell argued that Melville \"is justly said to be nineteenth-century America's leading poet after Whitman and Dickinson.\" and Helen Vendler remarked of Clarel: \"What it cost Melville to write this poem makes us pause, reading it. Alone, it is enough to win him, as a poet, what he called 'the belated funeral flower of fame'.\" Some critics now place him as the first modernist poet in the United States while others assert that his work more strongly suggests what today would be a postmodern view.\nMelville revival and Melville studies\n\nThe centennial of Melville's birth in 1919 coincided with a renewed interest in his writings known as the Melville revival where his work experienced a significant critical reassessment. The renewed appreciation began in 1917 with Carl Van Doren's article on Melville in a standard history of American literature. Van Doren also encouraged Raymond Weaver, who wrote the author's first full-length biography, Herman Melville: Mariner and Mystic (1921). Discovering the unfinished manuscript of Billy Budd, among papers shown to him by Melville's granddaughter, Weaver edited it and published it in a new collected edition of Melville's works. Other works that helped fan the flames for Melville were Carl Van Doren's The American Novel (1921), D. H. Lawrence's Studies in Classic American Literature (1923), Carl Van Vechten's essay in The Double Dealer (1922), and Lewis Mumford's biography Herman Melville (1929).\nStarting in the mid-1930s, the Yale University scholar Stanley Thomas Williams supervised more than a dozen dissertations on Melville that were eventually published as books. Where the first wave of Melville scholars focused on psychology, Williams' students were prominent in establishing Melville Studies as an academic field concerned with texts and manuscripts, tracing Melville's influences and borrowings (even plagiarism), and exploring archives and local publications. To provide historical evidence, the independent scholar Jay Leyda searched libraries, family papers, local archives and newspapers across New England and New York to document Melville's life day by day for his two-volume The Melville Log (1951). Sparked by Leyda and post-war scholars, the second phase of the Melville Revival emphasized research into the biography of Melville rather than accepting Melville's early books as reliable accounts.\n\nIn 1945, The Melville Society was founded, a non-profit organisation dedicated to the study of Melville's life and works. Between 1969 and 2003 it published 125 issues of Melville Society Extracts, which are now freely available on the society's website. Since 1999 it has published Leviathan: A Journal of Melville Studies, currently three issues a year, published by Johns Hopkins University Press.The postwar scholars tended to think that Weaver, Harvard psychologist Henry Murray, and Mumford favored Freudian interpretations which read Melville's fiction as autobiography; exaggerated his suffering in the family; and inferred a homosexual attachment to Hawthorne. They saw a different arc to Melville's writing career. The first biographers saw a tragic withdrawal after the cold critical reception for his prose works and largely dismissed his poetry. A new view emerged of Melville's turn to poetry as a conscious choice that placed him among the most important American poets. Other post-war studies, however, continued the broad imaginative and interpretive style; Charles Olson's Call Me Ishmael (1947) presented Ahab as a Shakespearean tragic hero, and Newton Arvin's critical biography, Herman Melville (1950), won the National Book Award for non-fiction in 1951.In the 1960s, Harrison Hayford organized an alliance between Northwestern University Press and the Newberry Library, with backing from the Modern Language Association and funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, to edit and publish reliable critical texts of Melville's complete works, including unpublished poems, journals, and correspondence. The first volume of the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of the Writings of Herman Melville was published in 1968 and the last in the fall of 2017. The aim of the editors was to present a text \"as close as possible to the author's intention as surviving evidence permits\". The volumes have extensive appendices, including textual variants from each of the editions published in Melville's lifetime, an historical note on the publishing history and critical reception, and related documents. Because the texts were prepared with financial support from the United States Department of Education, no royalties are charged, and they have been widely reprinted. Hershel Parker published his two-volume Herman Melville: A Biography, in 1996 and 2002, based on extensive original research and his involvement as editor of the Northwestern-Newberry Melville edition.\nGender studies\nMelville's writings did not attract the attention of women's studies scholars of the 1970s and 1980s, though his preference for sea-going tales that involved almost only males has been of interest to scholars in men's studies and especially gay and queer studies. Melville was remarkably open in his exploration of sexuality of all sorts. For example, Alvin Sandberg claimed that the short story \"The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids\" offers \"an exploration of impotency, a portrayal of a man retreating to an all-male childhood to avoid confrontation with sexual manhood,\" from which the narrator engages in \"congenial\" digressions in heterogeneity. In line with this view, Warren Rosenberg argues the homosocial \"Paradise of Bachelors\" is \"blind to what is real and painful in the world, and thus are superficial and sterile\".David Harley Serlin observes in the second half of Melville's diptych, \"The Tartarus of Maids\", the narrator gives voice to the oppressed women he observes:\n\nAs other scholars have noted, the \"slave\" image here has two clear connotations. One describes the exploitation of the women's physical labor, and the other describes the exploitation of the women's reproductive organs. Of course, as models of women's oppression, the two are clearly intertwined.\nIn the end Serlin says that the narrator is never fully able to come to terms with the contrasting masculine and feminine modalities.Issues of sexuality have been observed in other works as well. Rosenberg notes Taji, in Mardi, and the protagonist in Pierre \"think they are saving young 'maidens in distress' (Yillah and Isabel) out of the purest of reasons but both are also conscious of a lurking sexual motive\". When Taji kills the old priest holding Yillah captive, he says,\n\n[R]emorse smote me hard; and like lightning I asked myself whether the death deed I had done was sprung of virtuous motive, the rescuing of a captive from thrall, or whether beneath the pretense I had engaged in this fatal affray for some other selfish purpose, the companionship of a beautiful maid. \nIn Pierre, the motive of the protagonist's sacrifice for Isabel is admitted: \"womanly beauty and not womanly ugliness invited him to champion the right\". Rosenberg argues,\n\nThis awareness of a double motive haunts both books and ultimately destroys their protagonists who would not fully acknowledge the dark underside of their idealism. The epistemological quest and the transcendental quest for love and belief are consequently sullied by the erotic.\nRosenberg says that Melville fully explores the theme of sexuality in his major epic poem, Clarel. When the narrator is separated from Ruth, with whom he has fallen in love, he is free to explore other sexual (and religious) possibilities before deciding at the end of the poem to participate in the ritualistic order represented by marriage. In the course of the poem, \"he considers every form of sexual orientation \u2013 celibacy, homosexuality, hedonism, and heterosexuality \u2013 raising the same kinds of questions as when he considers Islam or Democracy\".Some passages and sections of Melville's works demonstrate his willingness to address all forms of sexuality, including the homoerotic, in his works. Commonly noted examples from Moby-Dick are the \"marriage bed\" episode involving Ishmael and Queequeg, who sleep with their arms wrapped around each other (Chapter 4, \"The Counterpane\" and Chapter 10, \"A Bosom Friend\"); and the \"Squeeze of the Hand\" (Chapter 94) describing the camaraderie of sailors' extracting spermaceti from a dead whale. The Clarel recognizes the homoerotic potential of its eponymous protagonist, including, in a fairly explicit passage, an erection provoked to him by the figure of a male interlocutor, Lyonesse. In addition, he notes that Billy Budd's physical attractiveness is described in quasi-feminine terms: \"As the Handsome Sailor, Billy Budd's position aboard the seventy-four was something analogous to that of a rustic beauty transplanted from the provinces and brought into competition with the highborn dames of the court\".\nLaw and literature\nSince the late 20th century, Billy Budd has become a central text in the field of legal scholarship known as law and literature. In the novel, Billy, a handsome and popular young sailor, is impressed from the merchant vessel Rights of Man to serve aboard H.M.S. Bellipotent in the late 1790s, during the war between Revolutionary France and Great Britain. He excites the enmity and hatred of the ship's master-at-arms, John Claggart. Claggart brings phony charges against Billy, accusing him of mutiny and other crimes, and the Captain, the Honorable Edward Fairfax Vere, brings them together for an informal inquiry. At this encounter, Billy is frustrated by his stammer, which prevents him from speaking, and strikes Claggart. The blow catches Claggart squarely on the forehead and, after a gasp or two, the master-at-arms dies. This death sets up the narrative climax of the novel; Vere immediately convenes a court-martial at which he urges the court to convict and sentence Billy to death.\nThe climactic trial has been the focus of scholarly inquiry regarding the motives of Vere and the legal necessity of Billy's condemnation. Vere states, given the circumstances of Claggart's slaying, condemning Billy to death would be unjust. While critics have viewed Vere as a character caught between the pressures between unbending legalism and malleable moral principles, other critics have differed in opinion. Such other critics have argued that Vere represents a ressentient protagonist whose disdain for Lord Admiral Nelson he takes out on Billy, in whom Vere sees the traits of Nelson's that he resents. Weisberg (1984) argues that Vere manipulated and misrepresented the applicable laws to condemn Billy, showing that the laws of the time did not require a sentence of death and that legally any such sentence required review before being carried out. While this argument has been criticized for drawing on information outside the novel, Weisberg also shows that sufficient liberties existed in the laws Melville describes to avoid a capital sentence.\nThemes\nMelville's work often touched on themes of communicative expression and the pursuit of the absolute among illusions. As early as 1839, in the juvenile sketch \"Fragments from a Writing Desk\", Melville explores a problem which would reappear in the short stories \"Bartleby\" (1853) and \"Benito Cereno\" (1855): the impossibility to find common ground for mutual communication. The sketch centers on the protagonist and a mute lady, leading scholar Sealts to observe: \"Melville's deep concern with expression and communication evidently began early in his career\".According to scholar Nathalia Wright, Melville's characters are all preoccupied by the same intense, superhuman and eternal quest for \"the absolute amidst its relative manifestations,\" an enterprise central to the Melville canon: \"All Melville's plots describe this pursuit, and all his themes represent the delicate and shifting relationship between its truth and its illusion\". It is not clear, however, what the moral and metaphysical implications of this quest are, because Melville did not distinguish between these two aspects. Throughout his life Melville struggled with and gave shape to the same set of epistemological doubts and the metaphysical issues these doubts engendered. An obsession for the limits of knowledge led to the question of God's existence and nature, the indifference of the universe, and the problem of evil.\nLegacy and honors\nIn 1982, the Library of America (LOA) began publication. In honor of Melville's central place in American culture, the very first volume contained Typee, Omoo, and Mardi. The first volumes published in 1983 and 1985 also contained Melville's work, in 1983 Redburn, White-Jacket, and Moby-Dick and in 1985 Pierre, Israel Potter, The Confidence-Man, Tales, and Billy Budd. LOA did not publish his complete poetry until 2019.\nOn August 1, 1984, as part of the Literary Arts Series of stamps, the United States Postal Service issued a 20-cent commemorative stamp to honor Melville. The setting for the first day of issue was the Whaling Museum in New Bedford, Massachusetts.In 1985, the New York City Herman Melville Society gathered at 104 East 26th Street to dedicate the intersection of Park Avenue South and 26th Street as Herman Melville Square. This is the street where Melville lived from 1863 to 1891 and where, among other works, he wrote Billy Budd. Melville's house in Lansingburgh, New York, houses the Lansingburgh Historical Society.\nIn 2010, a species of extinct giant sperm whale, Livyatan melvillei, was named in honor of Melville. The paleontologists who discovered the fossil were fans of Moby-Dick and dedicated their discovery to the author.\nSelected bibliography\nTypee: A Peep at Polynesian Life (1846)\nOmoo: A Narrative of Adventures in the South Seas (1847)\nMardi: and a Voyage Thither (1849)\nRedburn: His First Voyage (1849)\nWhite-Jacket; or, The World in a Man-of-War (1850)\nMoby-Dick; or, The Whale (1851)\nPierre; or, The Ambiguities (1852)\nIsle of the Cross (1853 unpublished, and now lost)\n\"Bartleby, the Scrivener\" (1853) (short story)\nThe Encantadas, or Enchanted Isles (1854)\n\"Benito Cereno\" (1855)\nIsrael Potter: His Fifty Years of Exile (1855)\nThe Confidence-Man: His Masquerade (1857)\nBattle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866) (poetry collection)\nClarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land (1876) (epic poem)\nJohn Marr and Other Sailors (1888) (poetry collection)\nTimoleon (1891) (poetry collection)\nBilly Budd, Sailor (An Inside Narrative) (1891 unfinished, published posthumously in 1924; authoritative edition in 1962)Notes\nReferences\n\nSources\nFurther reading\nBerthold, Dennis (2012).

He met Charles Baudelaire and the next year started writing art criticism under the pen-name \"Champfleury\" for the journal L'Artiste.  He was one of the first to promote the work of Gustave Courbet, in an article appearing in an issue of Le Pamphlet in 1848.\nIn 1850, during a time when the Spanish school was still largely ignored, he advocated the work of El Greco.  He wrote about the Le Nain brothers and Maurice Quentin de La Tour.  He also had a brief affair in 1851 with Eveline Ha\u0144ska, the widow of his friend Honor\u00e9 de Balzac.He edited the periodical Le r\u00e9alisme in 1856 and 1857.\nHis novels, of which the best-known is Les bourgeois de Molinchart (1854), were among the earliest Realist works.\nIn 1869 his book Les Chats, a series of essays about cats including portrayals of cats by prominent artists of the time, was published by Librairie de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Botanique de France, edited by J.

One of his private teaches was the Polish author and social activist Tomasz Zan, and it was to the latter's credit that the boy developed his passion for literature. In the late 1820s the family moved to Ufa where Mikhail studied in a gymnasium. In the mid-1830s he enrolled into the Saint Petersburg Institute of Railroad Engineers and, having graduated in 1842, went to work in Nizhny Novgorod.\nLiterary career\nIn 1849\u20131852 Sovremennik published three novels by Avdeev - Varenka, The Notes of Tamarin and Ivanov\u2014later to become known as the Tamarin trilogy. The hero, Tamarin, was seen by the author as a development of the Pechorin character; another 'superfluous man', eager to put his worthy qualities and moral strength to a socially useful action and failing to find any. The trilogy was very popular and for the rest of the decade Russian critics used the \"Tamarin\" token name as a symbol of a certain social type. Encouraged by the trilogy's success, Avdeev retired from the service and settled in his Orenburg Governorate family estate to become a professional writer. His Letters of a Vacant Man from Petersburg to the Province appeared in Sovremennik in 1853.In 1861 Avdeev returned to the state service, to work as a councilor in a local court specializing in land disputes, following the 1861 Land reform. In 1862 in poet Mikhail Mikhaylov's archives Avdeev's letters were found. He was arrested and deported to Penza. \"Cautious as he might be, his enunciations are often quite liberal and are of a Hertzen-like nature,\" the Russian secret police report maintained.In 1856 Avdeed was granted the permission to leave the country. Three years later he returned to Russia from France (where he became close to Ivan Turgenev) and in 1860 published his Underwater Rock novel, the idea of a 'free love' being its leitmotif. The novel was criticized for being schematic and 'cold'. \"Lifelessness in the major feature of all Avdeev's works,\" critic Nikolai Strakhov opined. Even less successful with critics was his Between the Two Fires (1868) novel, featuring landlord Kamyshlintsev as a main character, whose occupation seemed to be \"dreaming of big love and of some great cause to pursuit\" and whom Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin defined as \"the type of a Wanton Russian man\".Novelets Magdalene, The Motley Life and The Dried-Out Love (all 1870), dealing with married women's spiritual tribes and tribulations, established Avdeev as a \"divorce suit specialist\", according to Saltykov-Shchedrin. By this time the writer's popularity waned, yet critics from the liberal camp were eager to give him credit for \"helping to slacken these crashing fetters of a formalist morality and introduce the humane approach to the stale atmosphere of the society's notions about canons of family life,\" as Alexander Skabichevsky has put it. Avdeev's 1874 collection of essays Our Society as Shown in Heroes and Heroines of the 1820\u20131879 Russian Literature followed the Dobrolyubov's style of analytical social criticism, yet failed to produce the similar response. Avdeev wrote two plays, The Philistine Family and The Sixth Sense; the latter has been produced by the Alexandrinsky Theatre but failed to cause any stir.\nMikhail Avdeev died on  February 13 (February 1, o.s.), 1876, in Saint Petersburg. His last books, My Times in 1830s and In the Forties  were published posthumously.\nLegacy\nAvdeev's best-known work, the Tamarin trilogy, highlighting the tragedy of a gifted but socially inert man, was obviously lacking in originality, borrowing heavily from Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time, but also from Alexander Pushkin's Evgeny Onegin and Alexander Druzhinin's Polinka Zachs. \"Finely written, his novels lack in freshness and are sewn-up with well-worn fragments, while novelets are not suited at all for our age which sometimes forgives roughness of form, but never - the lack of ideas,\" wrote Nikolai Chernyshevsky, who saw the Tamarin character as a parody on that of Pechorin, by no means the development of it.And yet, according to the Russian Literary Dictionary, \"both readers and critics of the time admired Avdeev for his gift of storytelling, coupled with willingness to respond eagerly to any trendy theme or social issue.\" \"What made him popular was his liberal, humane attitude and the agility with which he was throwing himself headfast into every new social current,\" Alexander Skabichevsky wrote.\nSelected bibliography\nFiction\nVarenka\/The Notes of Tamarin\/Ivanov - the Tamarin trilogy (1849\u20131852, three novels)\nLetters of a Vacant Man to the Province About Life in Petersburg (Pisma 'pustovo tcheloveka' v provintsiyu o peterburgskoy zhizni, 1853, novelet).\nUnderwater Rock (Podvodny kamen, 1860, novel)\nBetween the Two Fires (Mezhdu dvukh ognei, 1868, novel)\nMagdalene (1870, novelet)\nThe Motley Life (Pyostrenkaya zhizn, 1870, novelet)\nThe Dried Out Love (Sukhaya lyubov, 1870, novelet)\nIn the Forties (V sorokovykh godakh, 1876, novel)Non-fiction\nOur Society as Shown in Heroes and Heroines of the 1820\u20131879 Russian Literature (Nashe obshchestvo [1820\u20131870] v geroyakh i geroinyakh russkoi literatury, 1874, essay collection)\nMy Times in 1830s (Moi vremena v 30-kh godakh, 1876, memoirs)Plays\nThe Philistine Family (Meshchanskaya semya, 1868)\nThe Sixth Sense (Shestoye tchuvstvo)References\nExternal links\n\n","12":"\n\nBayard Taylor (January 11, 1825\u00a0\u2013 December 19, 1878) was an American poet, literary critic,  translator, travel author, and diplomat.\n\nLife and work\nTaylor was born on January  11, 1825, in Kennett Square in Chester County, Pennsylvania. He was the fourth son, the first to survive to maturity, of the Quaker couple, Joseph and Rebecca (n\u00e9e Way) Taylor. His father was a wealthy farmer. Bayard received his early instruction in an academy at West Chester, Pennsylvania, and later at nearby Unionville. At the age of seventeen, he was apprenticed to a printer in West Chester. The influential critic and editor Rufus Wilmot Griswold encouraged him to write poetry. The volume that resulted, Ximena, or the Battle of the Sierra Morena, and other Poems, was published in 1844 and dedicated to Griswold.Using the money from his poetry and an advance for travel articles, he visited parts of England, France, Germany and Italy, making largely pedestrian tours for almost two years. He sent accounts of his travels to the Tribune, The Saturday Evening Post, and Gazette of the United States.In 1846, a collection of his articles was published in two volumes as Views Afoot, or Europe seen with Knapsack and Staff. That publication resulted in an invitation to serve as an editorial assistant for Graham's Magazine for a few months in 1848. That same year, Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, hired Taylor and sent him to California to report on the gold rush. He returned by way of Mexico and published another two-volume collection of travel essays, El Dorado; or, Adventures in the Path of Empire (1850). Within two weeks of release, the books sold 10,000 copies in the U.S. and 30,000 in Great Britain.\nIn 1849 Taylor married Mary Agnew, who died of tuberculosis the next year. That same year, Taylor won a popular competition sponsored by P. T. Barnum to write an ode for the \"Swedish Nightingale\", singer Jenny Lind. His poem \"Greetings to America\" was set to music by Julius Benedict and performed by the singer at numerous concerts on her tour of the United States.In 1851 he traveled to Egypt, where he followed the Nile River as far as 12\u00b0 30' N. He also traveled in Palestine and Mediterranean countries, writing poetry based on his experiences. Toward the end of 1852, he sailed from England to Calcutta, and then to China, where he joined the expedition of Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry to Japan. The results of these journeys were published as A Journey to Central Africa; or, Life and Landscapes from Egypt to the Negro Kingdoms of the White Nile (1854); The Lands of the Saracen; or, Pictures of Palestine, Asia Minor, Sicily and Spain (1854); and A Visit to India, China and Japan in the Year 1853 (1855).He returned to the U.S. on December 20, 1853, and undertook a successful public lecturer tour that extended from Maine to Wisconsin. After two years, he went to northern Europe to study Swedish life, language and literature. The trip inspired his long narrative poem Lars. His series of articles Swedish Letters to the Tribune were republished as Northern Travel: Summer and Winter Pictures (1857).\nIn Berlin in 1856, Taylor met the great German scientist Alexander von Humboldt, hoping to interview him for the New York Tribune. Humboldt was welcoming, and inquired whether they should speak English or German.  Taylor planned to go to central Asia, where Humboldt had traveled in 1829. Taylor informed Humboldt of Washington Irving's death; Humboldt had met him in Paris.  Taylor saw Humboldt again in 1857 at Potsdam.In October 1857, he married Maria Hansen, the daughter of the Danish\/German astronomer Peter Hansen. The couple spent the following winter in Greece. In 1859 Taylor returned to the American West and lectured at San Francisco.\nIn 1862, he was appointed to the U.S. diplomatic service as secretary of legation at St. Petersburg, and acting minister to Russia for a time during 1862-3 after the resignation of Ambassador Simon Cameron.\nHe published his first novel Hannah Thurston in 1863. The newspaper The New York Times first praised him for \"break[ing] new ground with such assured success\". A second much longer appreciation in the same newspaper was thoroughly negative, describing \"one pointless, aimless situation leading to another of the same stamp, and so on in maddening succession\". It concluded: \"The platitudes and puerilities which might otherwise only raise a smile, when confronted with such pompous pretensions, excite the contempt of every man who has in him the feeblest instincts of common honesty in literature.\" It proved successful enough for his publisher to announce another novel from him the next year.In 1864 Taylor and his wife Maria returned to the U.S. In 1866, Taylor traveled to Colorado and made a large loop through the northern mountains on horseback with a group that included William Byers, editor of the newspaper Rocky Mountain News. His letters describing this adventure were later compiled and published as Colorado: A Summer Trip.\nHis late novel, Joseph and His Friend: A Story of Pennsylvania (1870), first serialized in the magazine The Atlantic, was described as a story of young man in rural Pennsylvania and \"the troubles which arise from the want of a broader education and higher culture\". It is believed to be based on the poets Fitz-Greene Halleck and Joseph Rodman Drake, and since the late 20th-century has been called America's first gay novel. Taylor spoke at the dedication of a monument to Halleck in his native town, Guilford, Connecticut. He said that in establishing this monument to an American poet \"we symbolize the intellectual growth of the American people.... The life of the poet who sleeps here represents the long period of transition between the appearance of American poetry and the creation of an appreciative and sympathetic audience for it.\"Taylor imitated and parodied the writings of various poets in Diversions of the Echo Club (London, 1873; Boston, 1876). In 1874 Taylor traveled to Iceland to report for the Tribune on the one thousandth anniversary of the first European settlement there.\nOn July 4, 1876, at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Bayard recited his National Ode to an enthusiastic crowd of more than four thousand, the largest audience for a poetry reading in the United States to that date and a record which stood until 1961. The ode was written at the request of the exhibition's organizers, after the task had been declined by several other eminent poets, including John Greenleaf Whittier and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The work was reprinted in newspapers across the country and later published as a book in two separate editions.During March 1878, the U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment as United States Minister to Prussia. Mark Twain, who traveled to Europe on the same ship, was envious of Taylor's command of German.Taylor's travel writings were widely quoted by congressmen seeking to defend racial discrimination. Richard Townshend (D-IL) quoted passages from Taylor such as \"the Chinese are morally, the most debased people on the face of the earth\" and \"A Chinese city is the greatest of all abominations.\"A few months after arriving in Berlin, Taylor died there on December 19, 1878. His body was returned to the U.S. and buried in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. The New York Times published his obituary on its front page, referring to him as \"a great traveler, both on land and paper\". Shortly after his death, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote a memorial poem in Taylor's memory, at the urging of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.\n\nLegacy and honors\nCedarcroft, Taylor's home from 1859 to 1874, which he built near Kennett Square, is preserved as a National Historic Landmark.\nThe Bayard Taylor School was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.\nThe Bayard Taylor Memorial Library is in Kennett Square.Evaluations\nThough he wanted to be known most as a poet, Taylor was mostly recognized as a travel writer during his lifetime. Modern critics have generally accepted him as technically skilled in verse, but lacking imagination and, ultimately, consider his work as a conventional example of 19th-century sentimentalism.His translation of Faust, however, was recognized for its scholarly skill and remained in print through 1969. According to the 1920 edition of Encyclopedia Americana:\n\nIt is by his translation of Faust, one of the finest attempts of the kind in any literature, that Taylor is generally known; yet as an original poet he stands well up in the second rank of Americans. His Poems of the Orient and his Pennsylvania ballads comprise his best work. His verse is finished and sonorous, but at times over-rhetorical.\nAccording to the 1911 edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica:\n\nTaylor's most ambitious productions in poetry\u2014- his Masque of the Gods (Boston, 1872), Prince Deukalion; a lyrical drama (Boston, 1878), The Picture of St John (Boston, 1866), Lars; a Pastoral of Norway (Boston, 1873), and The Prophet; a tragedy (Boston, 1874)\u2014- are marred by a ceaseless effort to overstrain his power. But he will be remembered by his poetic and excellent translation of Goethe's Faust (2 vols, Boston, 1870-71) in the original metres.\nTaylor felt, in all truth, the torment and the ecstasy of verse; but, as a critical friend has written of him, his nature was so ardent, so full-blooded, that slight and common sensations intoxicated him, and he estimated their effect, and his power to transmit it to others, beyond the true value. He had, from the earliest period at which he began to compose, a distinct lyrical faculty: so keen indeed was his ear that he became too insistently haunted by the music of others, pre-eminently of Tennyson. But he had often a true and fine note of his own. His best short poems are The Metempsychosis of the Pine and the well-known Bedouin love-song.\n\nIn his critical essays Bayard Taylor had himself in no inconsiderable degree what he wrote of as that pure poetic insight which is the vital spirit of criticism. The most valuable of these prose dissertations are the Studies in German Literature (New York, 1879).\nIn Appletons' Cyclop\u00e6dia of American Biography of 1889, Edmund Clarence Stedman gives the following critique:\n\nHis poetry is striking for qualities that appeal to the ear and eye, finished, sonorous in diction and rhythm, at times too rhetorical, but rich in sound, color, and metrical effects. His early models were Byron and Shelley, and his more ambitious lyrics and dramas exhibit the latter's peculiar, often vague, spirituality. Lars, somewhat after the manner of Tennyson, is his longest and most attractive narrative poem. Prince Deukalion was designed for a masterpiece; its blank verse and choric interludes are noble in spirit and mould. Some of Taylor's songs, oriental idyls, and the true and tender Pennsylvanian ballads, have passed into lasting favor, and show the native quality of his poetic gift. His fame rests securely upon his unequalled rendering of Faust in the original metres, of which the first and second parts appeared in 1870 and 1871. His commentary upon Part II for the first time interpreted the motive and allegory of that unique structure.\nPublished works\nXimena, or the Battle of the Sierra Morena, and other Poems (1844)\nViews Afoot, or Europe seen with Knapsack and Staff (1846)\nRhymes of Travel: Ballads and Poems (1849)\nEl Dorado; or, Adventures in the Path of Empire (1850)\nRomances, Lyrics, and Songs (1852)\nJourney to Central Africa; or, Life and Landscapes from Egypt to the Negro Kingdoms of the White Nile, A (1854)\nA visit to India, China, and Japan in the year 1853 (1855)\nPoems of the Orient (Boston: Ticknor and Fields, 1855)\nPoems of Home and Travel (1856)\nCyclopedia of Modern Travel (1856)\nNorthern Travel: Summer and Winter Pictures (1857)\n Lands of the Saracen.; or, Pictures of Palestine, Asia Minor, Sicily and Spain, The (1859)\nView A-Foot, or Europe Seen with Knapsack and Staff (1859)\nLife, Travels And Books Of Alexander Von Humboldt, The (1859)\nAt Home and Abroad, First Series: A Sketch-book of Life, Scenery, and Men (1859)\nCyclopaedia of Modern Travel Vol I (1861)\nProse Writings: India, China, and Japan (1862)\nTravels in Greece and Russia, with an Excursion to Crete (1859)\nPoet's Journal (1863)\nHanna Thurston (1863)\nJohn Godfrey's Fortunes Related by Himself: A story of American Life (1864)\n\"Cruise On Lake Ladoga, A\" (1864)\n\"The Poems of Bayard Taylor\" (1865)\nJohn Godrey's Fortunes Related By Himself - A story of American Life (1865)\nThe Story of Kennett (1866)\nVisit To The Balearic Islands, Complete in Two Parts, A (1867)\nPicture of St. John, The (1867)\nColorado: A Summer Trip (1867)\n\"Little Land Of Appenzell, The\" (1867)\n\"Island of Maddalena with a Distant View of Caprera, The\" (1868)\n\"Land Of Paoli, The\" (1868)\n\"Catalonian Bridle-Roads\" (1868)\n\"Kyffhauser And Its Legend, The\" (1868)\nBy-Ways Of Europe (1869)\nJoseph and His Friend: A Story of Pennsylvania (1870)\nBallad of Abraham Lincoln, The (1870)\n\"Sights In And Around Yedo\" (1871)\nNorthern Travel (1871)\nJapan in Our Day (1872)\nMasque of the Gods, The (1872)\n\"Heart Of Arabia, The\" (1872)\nTravels in South Africa (1872)\nAt Home and Abroad: A Sketch-Book of Life, Scenery and Men (1872)\nDiversions of the Echo Club (1873)\nLars: A Pastoral of Norway (1873)\nWonders of the Yellowstone - The Illustrated Library of Travel, Exploration and Adventure (with James Richardson) (1873)\nNorthern Travel: Summer and Winter Pictures - Sweden, Denmark and Lapland (1873)\nLake Regions of Central Africa (1873)\nProphet: A Tragedy, The.

He was the dominant intellectual figure of the 1860s revolutionary democratic movement in Russia, despite spending much of his later life in exile to Siberia, and was later highly praised by Karl Marx, Georgi Plekhanov, and Vladimir Lenin.\n\nBiography\nThe son of a priest, Chernyshevsky was born in Saratov in 1828, and stayed there until 1846. He graduated at the local seminary  where he learned English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Greek and Old Slavonic. It was there he gained a love of literature. At St Petersburg University he often struggled to warm his room. He kept a diary of trivia like the number of tears he shed over a dead friend. It was here that he became an atheist.He was inspired by the works of Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach and Charles Fourier and particularly the works of Vissarion Belinsky and Alexander Herzen. After graduating from Saint Petersburg University in 1850, he taught literature at a gymnasium in Saratov. From 1853 to 1862, he lived in Saint Petersburg, and became the chief editor of Sovremennik (\u201cThe Contemporary\u201d), in which he published his main literary reviews and his essays on philosophy. By the time he graduated from the university, Chernyshevsky developed revolutionary, democratic, and materialist views. From 1851\u20131853, he taught Russian language and literature at the Saratov Gymnasium. He openly expressed his beliefs to students, some of whom later became revolutionaries.Chernyshevsky was sympathetic to the 1848 revolutions throughout Europe. He followed the events of the time and rejoiced in the gains of the democratic and revolutionary parties.In 1855, Chernyshevsky defended his master's dissertation, \"The Aesthetic Relation of Art to Reality\", which contributed for the development of materialist aesthetics in Russia. Chernyshevsky believed that \"What is of general interest in life -- that is the content of art\" and that art should be a \"textbook of life.\" He wrote, \"Science is not ashamed to say that its aim is to understand and explain reality, and then to use its explanation for man's benefit. Let not art be ashamed to admit that its aim is ... to reproduce this precious reality and explain it for the good of mankind.\"In 1862, he was arrested and confined in the Fortress of St. Peter and Paul, where he wrote his famous novel What Is to Be Done? The novel was an inspiration to many later Russian revolutionaries, who sought to emulate the novel's hero Rakhmetov, who was wholly dedicated to the revolution, ascetic in his habits and ruthlessly disciplined, to the point of sleeping on a bed of nails and eating only raw steak in order to build strength for the Revolution. Among those who have referenced the novel include Lenin, who wrote a political pamphlet of the same name.\nIn 1862, Chernyshevsky was sentenced to civil execution (mock execution), followed by penal servitude (1864\u20131872), and by exile to Vilyuisk,  Siberia (1872\u20131883). He died at the age of 61.\n\nIdeas and influence\nChernyshevsky was a founder of Narodism, Russian populism, and agitated for the revolutionary overthrow of the autocracy and the creation of a socialist society based on the old peasant commune. He exercised the greatest influence upon populist youth of the 1860s and 1870s. Chernyshevsky believed that American democracy was the best aspect of American life. He welcomed the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, which he believed marked a new period for \"the great North American people\" and that America would progress to heights \"not attained since Jefferson's time.\" He praised these developments: \"The good repute of the North American nation is important for all nations with the rapidly growing significance of the North American states in the life of all humanity.\" Chernyshevsky's ideas were heavily influenced by Alexander Herzen, Vissarion Belinsky, and Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach. He saw class struggle as the means of society's forward movement and advocated for the interests of the working people. In his view, the masses were the chief maker of history. He is reputed to have used the phrase \u201cthe worse the better\u201d, to indicate that the worse the social conditions became for the poor, the more inclined they would be to launch a revolution (though he did not originate the phrase, which predates his birth; for example, in an 1814 letter John Adams used it when discussing the lead-up to the American revolution).\nThere are those arguing, in the words of Professor Joseph Frank, that \u201cChernyshevsky\u2019s novel What Is to Be Done?, far more than Marx\u2019s Das Kapital, supplied the emotional dynamic that eventually went to make the Russian Revolution\u201d.Fyodor Dostoyevsky was enraged by what he saw as the simplicity of the political and psychological ideas expressed in the book, and wrote Notes from Underground largely as a reaction against it.\nRussian revolutionary and Prime Minister Vladimir Lenin praised Chernyshevsky: \"..he approached all the political events of his times in a revolutionary spirit and was able to exercise a revolutionary influence by advocating, in spite of all the barriers and obstacles placed in his way by the censorship, the idea of a peasant revolution, the idea of the struggle of the masses for the overthrow of all the old authorities\u201d Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels studied Chernyshevsky's works and called him a \"great Russian scholar and critic\".A number of scholars have contended that Ayn Rand, who grew up in Russia when Chernyshevsky's novel was still influential and ubiquitous, was influenced by the book.\nWorks\nAesthetic Relations of Art to Reality [1] From:Russian Philosophy Volume II: The Nihilists, The Populists, Critics of Religion and Culture, Quadrangle Books 1965;\nEssays on the Gogol Period in Russian Literature\nCritique of Philosophical Prejudices Against Communal Ownership\nThe Anthropological Principle in Philosophy\nWhat Is to Be Done?

He was the dominant intellectual figure of the 1860s revolutionary democratic movement in Russia, despite spending much of his later life in exile to Siberia, and was later highly praised by Karl Marx, Georgi Plekhanov, and Vladimir Lenin.\n\nBiography\nThe son of a priest, Chernyshevsky was born in Saratov in 1828, and stayed there until 1846. He graduated at the local seminary  where he learned English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Greek and Old Slavonic. It was there he gained a love of literature. At St Petersburg University he often struggled to warm his room. He kept a diary of trivia like the number of tears he shed over a dead friend. It was here that he became an atheist.He was inspired by the works of Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach and Charles Fourier and particularly the works of Vissarion Belinsky and Alexander Herzen. After graduating from Saint Petersburg University in 1850, he taught literature at a gymnasium in Saratov. From 1853 to 1862, he lived in Saint Petersburg, and became the chief editor of Sovremennik (\u201cThe Contemporary\u201d), in which he published his main literary reviews and his essays on philosophy. By the time he graduated from the university, Chernyshevsky developed revolutionary, democratic, and materialist views. From 1851\u20131853, he taught Russian language and literature at the Saratov Gymnasium. He openly expressed his beliefs to students, some of whom later became revolutionaries.Chernyshevsky was sympathetic to the 1848 revolutions throughout Europe. He followed the events of the time and rejoiced in the gains of the democratic and revolutionary parties.In 1855, Chernyshevsky defended his master's dissertation, \"The Aesthetic Relation of Art to Reality\", which contributed for the development of materialist aesthetics in Russia. Chernyshevsky believed that \"What is of general interest in life -- that is the content of art\" and that art should be a \"textbook of life.\" He wrote, \"Science is not ashamed to say that its aim is to understand and explain reality, and then to use its explanation for man's benefit. Let not art be ashamed to admit that its aim is ... to reproduce this precious reality and explain it for the good of mankind.\"In 1862, he was arrested and confined in the Fortress of St. Peter and Paul, where he wrote his famous novel What Is to Be Done? The novel was an inspiration to many later Russian revolutionaries, who sought to emulate the novel's hero Rakhmetov, who was wholly dedicated to the revolution, ascetic in his habits and ruthlessly disciplined, to the point of sleeping on a bed of nails and eating only raw steak in order to build strength for the Revolution. Among those who have referenced the novel include Lenin, who wrote a political pamphlet of the same name.\nIn 1862, Chernyshevsky was sentenced to civil execution (mock execution), followed by penal servitude (1864\u20131872), and by exile to Vilyuisk,  Siberia (1872\u20131883). He died at the age of 61.\n\nIdeas and influence\nChernyshevsky was a founder of Narodism, Russian populism, and agitated for the revolutionary overthrow of the autocracy and the creation of a socialist society based on the old peasant commune. He exercised the greatest influence upon populist youth of the 1860s and 1870s. Chernyshevsky believed that American democracy was the best aspect of American life. He welcomed the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, which he believed marked a new period for \"the great North American people\" and that America would progress to heights \"not attained since Jefferson's time.\" He praised these developments: \"The good repute of the North American nation is important for all nations with the rapidly growing significance of the North American states in the life of all humanity.\" Chernyshevsky's ideas were heavily influenced by Alexander Herzen, Vissarion Belinsky, and Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach. He saw class struggle as the means of society's forward movement and advocated for the interests of the working people. In his view, the masses were the chief maker of history. He is reputed to have used the phrase \u201cthe worse the better\u201d, to indicate that the worse the social conditions became for the poor, the more inclined they would be to launch a revolution (though he did not originate the phrase, which predates his birth; for example, in an 1814 letter John Adams used it when discussing the lead-up to the American revolution).\nThere are those arguing, in the words of Professor Joseph Frank, that \u201cChernyshevsky\u2019s novel What Is to Be Done?, far more than Marx\u2019s Das Kapital, supplied the emotional dynamic that eventually went to make the Russian Revolution\u201d.Fyodor Dostoyevsky was enraged by what he saw as the simplicity of the political and psychological ideas expressed in the book, and wrote Notes from Underground largely as a reaction against it.\nRussian revolutionary and Prime Minister Vladimir Lenin praised Chernyshevsky: \"..he approached all the political events of his times in a revolutionary spirit and was able to exercise a revolutionary influence by advocating, in spite of all the barriers and obstacles placed in his way by the censorship, the idea of a peasant revolution, the idea of the struggle of the masses for the overthrow of all the old authorities\u201d Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels studied Chernyshevsky's works and called him a \"great Russian scholar and critic\".A number of scholars have contended that Ayn Rand, who grew up in Russia when Chernyshevsky's novel was still influential and ubiquitous, was influenced by the book.\nWorks\nAesthetic Relations of Art to Reality [1] From:Russian Philosophy Volume II: The Nihilists, The Populists, Critics of Religion and Culture, Quadrangle Books 1965;\nEssays on the Gogol Period in Russian Literature\nCritique of Philosophical Prejudices Against Communal Ownership\nThe Anthropological Principle in Philosophy\nWhat Is to Be Done?

He studied law in Rouen and Paris, but eventually literature became his passion. He worked as a dramatic critic for Lloyd Francais and as a literary critic for L'Opinion Nationale.\nHis first book, published in 1859, was Les Amants. In total Malot wrote over 70 books. By far his most famous book is Sans Famille (Nobody's Boy, 1878), which deals with the travels of the young orphan Remi, who is sold to the street musician Vitalis at age 8. Sans Famille gained fame as a children's book, though it was not originally intended as such.\nHe announced his retirement as an author of fiction in 1895, but in 1896 he returned with the novel L'amour Dominateur as well as the account of his literary life Le Roman de mes Romans (The Novel of my Novels).\nHe died in Fontenay-sous-Bois in 1907.\n\nWorks by Malot\nVictimes d'Amour (a trilogy)\nLes Amants (1859)\nLes Epoux (1865)\nLes Enfants (1869)\nLes Amours de Jacques (1860)\nUn beau-fr\u00e8re (1869)\nUne belle-m\u00e8re (1869)\nLes Aventures de Romain Kalbris (1869)\nUne Bonne affaire (1870)\nMme Obernin (1870)\nUn Cur\u00e9 de Province (1872)\nUn Mariage sous le Second Empire (1873)\nL'Auberge du Monde (1875\u20131876, 4 vols.)\nLes Batailles du Mariage (1877, 3 vols.)\nCara (1877)\nSans famille (1878) Translated in 1916 as \"Nobody's boy\" by Florence Crewe-Jones (1880-1946)\nLe Docteur Claude (1879)\nLa Boh\u00eame Tapageuse (1880, 3 vols.)\nPompon, and Une Femme d'Argent (1881)\nLa Petite Soeur (1882)\nLes Millions Honteux (1882)\nLes Besogneux (1883)\nPaulette (1883)\nMarichette, and Micheline (1884)\nLe Lieutenant Bonnet (1885)\nSang Bleu (1885)\nBaccara (1886)\nZyte (1886)\nVices Fran\u00e7ais, S\u00e9duction, and Ghislaine (1887)\nMondaine (1888)\nMariage Riche, and Justice (1889)\nLa M\u00e8re (1890)\nAnie (1891)\nComplices (1892)\nConscience (1892) Translated in 1892 by Lita Angelica Rice (1855-1942)\nEn Famille (1893) Translated in 1922 as \"Nobody's girl\" by Florence Crewe-Jones (1880-1946)\nAmours de Jeunes et Amours de Vieux (1894)\nL'amour dominateur (1896)\nLe Roman de mes Romans (1896)\nPages choisies (1898)Legacy\nThree anime series have been made based on Malot's works:\n\nNobody's Boy: Remi (1977, 51 episodes, based on Sans Famille)\nThe Story of Perrine (1978, 53 episodes, based on En Famille)\nRemi, Nobody's Girl (1996, 26 episodes, based on Sans Famille with gender swap)External links\nWorks by Hector Malot at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by or about Hector Malot at Internet Archive\nWorks by Hector Malot at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nJules Alfred Huot de Goncourt (pronounced\u00a0[\u0292yl d\u0259 \u0261\u0254\u0303ku\u0281]; 17 December 1830\u00a0\u2013 20 June 1870) was a French writer, who published books together with his brother Edmond.

She was described as \"a young woman of extreme passions and fastidious principles\" and \"at once a powerful reasoner and an inexorable critic of reason\".\nLife and career\nChildhood\nWedgwood was the daughter and the eldest of the six children of Hensleigh Wedgwood and his wife Fanny Mackintosh, the daughter of Sir James Mackintosh.  She was a great-granddaughter of the potter Josiah Wedgwood and niece of Charles Darwin. Her strong intellect was apparent early and she taught herself Latin, Greek, French, German and drawing, however her only formal education was at the age of 13 at Rachel Martineau's school in Liverpool. Her mother ran a salon in Cumberland Place attended by Macaulay, Thackeray, F. D. Maurice, Ruskin, and Carlyle.\nEarly career and fictional works\nWedgwood was acknowledged as \"the cleverest of her generation\" in the extended Wedgwood\u2013Darwin\u2013Mackintosh family and she acquired renown as a \"brilliant conversationalist with a passion for scientific and theological debate\". In her twenties she wrote the novels \"An Old Debt\" and \"Framleigh Hall\" addressing \"intellectual conflict, confused gender roles, and ill-starred sexual passion\", which were well received by the public. Faced with her father's disapproval of her writing skills and topics, however, Wedgwood abandoned a third novel despite encouragement by Mrs Gaskell, whom she assisted in research for The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb (published in 1857). She concluded that \"she had no imaginative powers\" and that her \"mind was 'merely analytical'\".\nFather-daughter relationship\nIn existing accounts of the relationship between Hensleigh Wedgwood and his eldest daughter Julia, the former has been presented as the archetypal austere and bullying Victorian father who had little regard for his daughter\u2019s emotional well-being, or for her position in society as an intellectual woman in her own right. However, a recent account of the relationship challenges this prevailing reading and shows the father-daughter relationship in a more nuanced light than has been given credit.\nObstacles and non-fictional works\nDue to expectations on an unmarried woman in a large family, and by her chronic deafness, Wedgwood's work was severely impeded. \"Her reading and writing were done between five and seven in the morning\" and most of her life was spent caring for ill relatives and for relatives' children. She published some book reviews while caring for a brother, then in 1861 an article on the theological significance of On the Origin of Species. In response Charles Darwin wrote her a letter stating \"I must tell you how much I admire your Article (...) I think that you understand my book perfectly, and that I find a very rare event with my critics\", expressing himself inspired to \u2013 and challenged by \u2013 further thought on the topics she had brought up.\nShe was a close friend of Robert Browning for some years, correspondence with whom survives for the years 1863 to 1870.In 1870, Wedgwood published a much lauded book on the life and historical significance of John Wesley. She set up her own household in Notting Hill and in the following years she helped Charles Darwin translate the works of Linnaeus as well as publishing an array of clear and precise articles on science, religion, philosophy, literature, and social reform. At her London home, Wedgwood also worked on \"a history of the evolution of ethics in the great world civilizations, from earliest antiquity down to the scientific positivism and theological modernism of the mid-nineteenth century\", which was published as \"The Moral Ideal: a Historic Study\" in 1888. The success of this work led to the republication of her novels.\nUpon the death of her mother in 1889 she gave up her own house to care for her father.Five years later, she published a follow-up work to \"The Moral Ideal\" \u2013 \"The Message of Israel\" \u2013 with the aim of re-interpreting the Judaeic tradition critically in the light of \u2018modernism\u2019. In 1909 a collection of her major articles was published. She was also persuaded to work on a biography of her great-grandfather, which was finished after her death by Professor C. H. Herford.\nReligion and later life\nThroughout her life Wedgwood was interested in the boundaries between scientific knowledge and religious belief and was influenced by James Martineau, Alexander John Scott, and especially Thomas Erskine. In her later years she donated extensively for the construction and extension of Church of England churches. She had been active in the anti-vivisection movement since the 1860s and bequeathed it much of her fortune upon her death on 26 November 1913.\nBibliography\nAn Old Debt (as Florence Dawson), 1858\nFramleigh Hall, 1858\nLife of John Wesley, 1870\nThe Moral Ideal, 1888 and 1907\nThe Message of Israel, 1894\nNineteenth Century Teachers, 1909References\nExternal links\nFrances Julia Wedgwood, 1833\u20131913 (Wedgwood, Snow)\u00a0: Darwin Correspondence Project \u2013 with links to her letters to and from Charles Darwin.\n\n","19":"William Dean Howells (; March 1, 1837 \u2013 May 11, 1920) was an American realist novelist, literary critic, and playwright, nicknamed \"The Dean of American Letters\". He was particularly known for his tenure as editor of The Atlantic Monthly, as well as for his own prolific writings, including the Christmas story \"Christmas Every Day\" and the novels The Rise of Silas Lapham and A Traveler from Altruria.\n\nBiography\nEarly life and family\nWilliam Dean Howells was born on March 1, 1837, in Martinsville, Ohio (now known as Martins Ferry, Ohio), to William Cooper Howells and Mary Dean Howells, the second of eight children. His father was a newspaper editor and printer who moved frequently around Ohio. In 1840, the family settled in Hamilton, Ohio, where his father oversaw a Whig newspaper and followed Swedenborgianism. Their nine years there were the longest period that they stayed in one place. The family had to live frugally, although the young Howells was encouraged by his parents in his literary interests. He began at an early age to help his father with typesetting and printing work, a job known at the time as a printer's devil. In 1852, his father arranged to have one of his poems published in the Ohio State Journal without telling him.\n\nEarly career\nIn 1856, Howells was elected as a clerk in the State House of Representatives. In 1858, he began to work at the Ohio State Journal where he wrote poetry and short stories, and also translated pieces from French, Spanish, and German. He avidly studied German and other languages and was greatly interested in Heinrich Heine. In 1860, he visited Boston and met with writers James T. Fields, James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. He became a personal friend to many of them, including Henry Adams, William James, Henry James, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\nIn 1860 Howells wrote Abraham Lincoln's campaign biography Life of Abraham Lincoln and subsequently gained a consulship in Venice. He married Elinor Mead on Christmas Eve 1862 at the American embassy in Paris. She was a sister of sculptor Larkin Goldsmith Mead and architect William Rutherford Mead of the firm McKim, Mead, and White. Among their children was architect John Mead Howells.\n\nEditorship and other literary pursuits\nThe Howells returned to America in 1865 and settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He wrote for various magazines, including The Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Magazine. In January 1866, James Fields offered him a position as assistant editor at The Atlantic Monthly; he accepted after successfully negotiating for a higher salary, though he was frustrated by Fields' close supervision.Howells was made editor in 1871, after five years as assistant editor, and he remained in this position until 1881. In 1869, he met Mark Twain with whom he formed a longtime friendship. But his relationship with journalist Jonathan Baxter Harrison was more important for the development of his literary style and his advocacy of Realism. Harrison wrote a series of articles for The Atlantic Monthly during the 1870s on the lives of ordinary Americans. Howells gave a series of twelve lectures on \"Italian Poets of Our Century\" for the Lowell Institute during its 1870-71 season.He published his first novel Their Wedding Journey in 1872, but his literary reputation soared with the realist novel A Modern Instance (1882), which described the decay of a marriage. His 1885 novel The Rise of Silas Lapham became his best known work, describing the rise and fall of an American entrepreneur of the paint business. His social views were also strongly represented in the novels Annie Kilburn (1888), A Hazard of New Fortunes (1890), and An Imperative Duty (1891).\nHe was particularly outraged by the trials resulting from the Haymarket Riot, which led him to portray a similar riot in A Hazard of New Fortunes and to write publicly to protest the trials of the men allegedly involved in the Haymarket affair. In his public writing and in his novels, he drew attention to pressing social issues of the time. He joined the Anti-Imperialist League in 1898, in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines.\nHis poems were collected in 1873 and 1886, and a volume was published in 1895 under the title Stops of Various Quills. He was the initiator of the school of American realists, and he had little sympathy with any other type of fiction. However, he frequently encouraged new writers in whom he discovered new ideas or new fictional techniques, such as Stephen Crane, Frank Norris, Hamlin Garland, Harold Frederic, Abraham Cahan, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Paul Laurence Dunbar.\n\nLater years\nIn 1902, Howells published The Flight of Pony Baker, a book for children partly inspired by his own childhood. That same year, he bought a summer home overlooking the Piscataqua River in Kittery Point, Maine. He returned there annually until Elinor's death when he left the house to his son and family and moved to a house in York Harbor. His grandson, John Noyes Mead Howells, donated the property to Harvard University as a memorial in 1979. In 1904 he was one of the first seven people chosen for membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters, of which he became president.\nIn February 1910, Elinor Howells began using morphine to treat her worsening neuritis. She died on May 6, a few days after her birthday, and only two weeks after the death of Howells's friend Mark Twain. Henry James offered his condolences, writing, \"I think of this laceration of your life with an infinite sense of all it will mean for you\". Howells and his daughter Mildred decided to spend part of the year in their Cambridge home on Concord Avenue; though, without Elinor, they found it \"dreadful in its ghostliness and ghastliness\".Howells died in his sleep shortly after midnight on May 11, 1920, and was buried in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Eight years later his daughter published his correspondence as a biography of his literary life.\n\nLiterary criticism\nIn addition to his own creative works, Howells also wrote criticism, and essays about contemporary literary figures such as Henrik Ibsen, \u00c9mile Zola, Giovanni Verga, Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s, and, especially, Leo Tolstoy, which helped establish their reputations in the United States. He also wrote critically in support of American writers Hamlin Garland, Stephen Crane, Emily Dickinson, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Sarah Orne Jewett, Charles W. Chesnutt, Abraham Cahan, Madison Cawein, and Frank Norris. It is perhaps in this role that he had his greatest influence. In his \"Editor's Study\" column at The Atlantic Monthly and, later, at Harper's, he formulated and disseminated his theories of \"realism\" in literature.\nHowells viewed realism as \"nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material.\"\nIn defense of the real, as opposed to the ideal, he wrote, \"I hope the time is coming when not only the artist, but the common, average man, who always 'has the standard of the arts in his power,' will have also the courage to apply it, and will reject the ideal grasshopper wherever he finds it, in science, in literature, in art, because it is not 'simple, natural, and honest,' because it is not like a real grasshopper. But I will own that I think the time is yet far off, and that the people who have been brought up on the ideal grasshopper, the heroic grasshopper, the impassioned grasshopper, the self-devoted, adventureful, good old romantic card-board grasshopper, must die out before the simple, honest, and natural grasshopper can have a fair field.\"\nHowells believed the future of American writing was not in poetry but in novels, a form which he saw shifting from \"romance\" to a serious form.Howells was a Christian socialist whose ideals were greatly influenced by Russian writer Leo Tolstoy. He joined a Christian socialist group in Boston between 1889 and 1891 and attended several churches, including the First Spiritual Temple and the Church of the Carpenter, the latter being affiliated with the Episcopal Church and the Society of Christian Socialists. These influences led him to write on issues of social justice from a moral and egalitarian point of view, being critic of the social effects of industrial capitalism. He was, however, not a Marxist.\nReception\nNoting the \"documentary\" and truthful value of Howells' work, Henry James wrote: \"Stroke by stroke and book by book your work was to become, for this exquisite notation of our whole democratic light and shade and give and take, in the highest degree documentary.\" The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing read two of Howell's works, The Shadow of a Dream and A Fearful Responsibility, calling the latter \"inane triviality\".  Bliss Perry considered a knowledge of his work vital for an understanding of the American provincial novel and believed that \"he has never in his long career written an insincere, a slovenly, or an infelicitous page.\"\nGallery\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks\nLives and Speeches of Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin (New York, W.

Nevertheless, Assis did not achieve widespread popularity outside Brazil during his lifetime. In 1897 he founded and became the first President of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. He was multilingual, having taught himself French, English, German and Greek in later life.\nBorn in Morro do Livramento, Rio de Janeiro from a poor, mixed-race family, he was the grandson of freed slaves in a country where slavery wouldn't be fully abolished until 49 years later. Machado faced the many challenges of being of mixed race in the 19th century, including limited access to formal education. He barely studied in public schools and never attended university. With only his own intellect to rely on, and largely self-taught, he struggled to rise socially.  To do so, he took several public positions, passing through the Ministry of Agriculture, Trade and Public Works, and achieving early fame in newspapers where he published his first poetry and chronicles. \nMachado's work shaped the realism movement in Brazil. He became known for his wit and his eye-opening critiques of society. Generally considered to be Machado's greatest works are Dom Casmurro (1899), Mem\u00f3rias P\u00f3stumas de Br\u00e1s Cubas (\"Posthumous Memoirs of Br\u00e1s Cubas\", also translated as Epitaph of a Small Winner) and Quincas Borba (also known in English as Philosopher or Dog?). In 1893 he published \"A Missa do Galo\" (\"Midnight Mass\"), often considered to be the greatest short story in Brazilian literature. American literary critic Harold Bloom's included Machado de Assis in his list of 100 geniuses of literature. Bloom considers him the greatest black writer in Western literature.\n\nBiography\nBirth and adolescence\nJoaquim Maria Machado de Assis was born on 21 June 1839 in Rio de Janeiro, then capital of the Empire of Brazil. His parents were Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Assis, a wall painter, the son of freed slaves, and Maria Leopoldina da C\u00e2mara Machado, a Portuguese washerwoman from the Azores. He was born in Livramento country house, owned by Dona Maria Jos\u00e9 de Mendon\u00e7a Barroso Pereira, widow of senator Bento Barroso Pereira, who protected his parents and allowed them to live with her. Dona Maria Jos\u00e9 became Joaquim's godmother; her brother-in-law, commendatory Joaquim Alberto de Sousa da Silveira, was his godfather, and both were paid homage by giving their names to the baby. Machado had a sister who died young. Joaquim studied in a public school, but was not a good student. While helping to serve masses, he met Father Silveira Sarmento, who became his Latin teacher and also a good friend.When Joaquim was ten years old, his mother died, and his father took him along as he moved to S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o. Francisco de Assis met the mulatta Maria In\u00eas da Silva, and they married in 1854. Joaquim had classes in a school for girls only, thanks to his stepmother who worked there making candies. At night he learned French with an immigrant baker. In his adolescence, he met the mulatto Francisco de Paulo Brito, who owned a bookstore, a newspaper and typography. On 12 January 1855, Francisco de Paula published the poem Ela (\"Her\") written by Joaquim, then 15 years old, in the newspaper Marmota Fluminense. In the following year, he was hired as typographer's apprentice in the Imprensa Oficial (the Official Press, charged with the publication of Government measures), where he was encouraged as a writer by Manuel Ant\u00f4nio de Almeida, the newspaper's director and also a novelist. There he also met Francisco Otaviano, journalist and later liberal senator, and Quintino Bocai\u00fava, who decades later would become known for his role as a republican orator.\nEarly career and education\nFrancisco Otaviano hired Machado to work on the newspaper Correio Mercantil as a proofreader in 1858. He continued to write for the Marmota Fluminense and also for several other newspapers, but he did not earn much and had a humble life. As he did not live with his father anymore, it was common for him to eat only once a day for lack of money.Around this time, he became a friend of the writer and liberal politician Jos\u00e9 de Alencar, who taught him English. From English literature, he was influenced by Laurence Sterne, William Shakespeare, Lord Byron and Jonathan Swift. He learned German years later and in his old age, Greek. He was invited by Bocai\u00fava to work at his newspaper Di\u00e1rio do Rio de Janeiro in 1860. Machado had a passion for theater and wrote several plays for a short time; his friend Bocai\u00fava concluded: \"Your works are meant to be read and not played.\" He gained some notability and began to sign his writings as J. M. Machado de Assis, the way he would be known for posterity: Machado de Assis. He established himself in advanced Liberal Party circles by taking stands in defense of religious freedom and Ernest Renan's controversial Life of Jesus while attacking the venality of the clergy.\nHis father Francisco de Assis died in 1864. Machado learned of his father's death through acquaintances. He dedicated his compilation of poems called \"Cris\u00e1lidas\" to his father: \"To the Memory of Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Assis and Maria Leopoldina Machado de Assis, my Parents.\" With the Liberal Party's ascension to power about that time, Machado thought he might receive a patronage position that would help him improve his life. To his surprise, aid came from the Emperor Dom Pedro II, who hired him as director-assistant in the Di\u00e1rio Oficial in 1867, and knighted him as an honor. In 1888 Machado was made an officer of the Order of the Rose.\nMarriage and family\nIn 1868 Machado met the Portuguese Carolina Augusta Xavier de Novais, five years older than him. She was the sister of his colleague Faustino Xavier de Novais, for whom he worked on the magazine O Futuro. Machado had a stammer and was extremely shy, short and lean. He was also very intelligent and well learned. He married Carolina on 12 November 1869; although her parents Miguel and Adelaide, and her siblings disapproved because Machado was mulatto and she was of purely European ancestry. They had no children.\nLiterature\nMachado managed to rise in his bureaucratic career, first in the Agriculture Department. Three years later, he became the head of a section in it. He published two poetry books: Falenas, in 1870, and Americanas, in 1875. Their weak reception made him explore other literary genres.\nHe wrote five romantic novels: Ressurrei\u00e7\u00e3o, A M\u00e3o e Luva, Helena and Iai\u00e1 Garcia. The books were a success with the public, but literary critics considered them mediocre. Machado suffered repeated attacks of epilepsy, apparently related to hearing of the death of his old friend Jos\u00e9 de Alencar. He was left melancholic, pessimistic and fixed on death. His next book, marked by \"a skeptical and realistic tone\": Mem\u00f3rias P\u00f3stumas de Br\u00e1s Cubas (Posthumous Memoirs of Br\u00e1s Cubas, also translated as Epitaph of a Small Winner), is widely considered a masterpiece. By the end of the 1880s, Machado had gained wide renown as a writer.Although he was opposed to slavery, he never spoke against it in public. He avoided discussing politics. He was criticized by the abolitionist Jos\u00e9 do Patroc\u00ednio and by the writer Lima Barreto for staying away from politics, especially the cause of abolition. He was also criticized by them for having married a white woman. Machado was caught by surprise with the monarchy overthrown on 15 November 1889. Machado had no sympathy towards republicanism, as he considered himself a liberal monarchist and venerated Pedro II, whom he perceived as \"a humble, honest, well-learned and patriotic man, who knew how to make of a throne a chair [for his simplicity], without diminishing its greatness and respect.\" When a commission went to the public office where he worked to remove the picture of the former emperor, the shy Machado defied them: \"The picture got in here by an order and it shall leave only by another order.\"The birth of the Brazilian republic made Machado become more critical and an observer of the Brazilian society of his time. From then on, he wrote \"not only the greatest novels of his time, but the greatest of all time of Brazilian literature.\" Works such as Quincas Borba (Philosopher or Dog?) (1891), Dom Casmurro (1899), Esa\u00fa e Jac\u00f3 (1904) and Memorial de Aires (1908), considered masterpieces, were successes with both critics and the public. In 1893 he published \"A Missa do Galo\" (\"Midnight Mass\"), considered his greatest short story.\nLater years\nMachado de Assis, along with fellow monarchists such as Joaquim Nabuco, Manuel de Oliveira Lima, Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto and Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay, and other writers and intellectuals, founded the Brazilian Academy of Letters. He was its first president, from 1897 to 1908, when he died. For many years, he requested that the government grant a proper headquarters to the Academy, which he managed to obtain in 1905. In 1902 he was transferred to the accountancy's directing board of the Ministry of Industry.His wife Carolina Novais died on 20 October 1904, after 35 years of a \"perfect married life\". Feeling depressed and lonely, Machado died on 29 September 1908.\nNarrative style\nMachado's style is unique, and several literary critics have tried to describe it since 1897. He is considered by many the greatest Brazilian writer of all time, and one of the world's greatest novelists and short story writers. His chronicles do not share the same status. His poems are often misunderstood for the use of crude terms, sometimes associated to the pessimist style of Augusto dos Anjos, another Brazilian writer.\nMachado de Assis was included on American literary critic Harold Bloom's list of the greatest 100 geniuses of literature, alongside writers such as Dante, Shakespeare and Cervantes. Bloom considers him the greatest black writer in Western literature; this is based on United States's conceptions of race, which are not the same in Brazil, where he is considered mulato.His works have been studied by critics in various countries of the world, such as Giuseppe Alpi (Italy), Lourdes Andreassi (Portugal), Albert Bagby Jr. (US), Abel Barros Baptista (Portugal), Hennio Morgan Birchal (Brazil), Edoardo Bizzarri (Italy), Jean-Michel Massa (France), Helen Caldwell (US), John Gledson (England), Adrien Delpech (France), Albert Dessau (Germany), Paul B. Dixon (US), Keith Ellis (US), Edith Fowke (Canada), Anatole France (France), Richard Graham (US), Pierre Hourcade (France), David Jackson (US), G. Reginald Daniel (US), Linda Murphy Kelley (US), John C. Kinnear, Alfred Mac Adam (US), Victor Orban (France), Daphne Patai (US), Houwens Post (Italy), Samuel Putnam (US), John Hyde Schmitt, Tony Tanner (England), Jack E. Tomlins (US), Carmelo Virgillo (US), Dieter Woll (Germany), August Willemsen (Netherlands) and Susan Sontag (US).Critics are divided as to the nature of Machado de Assis's writing. Some, such as Abel Barros Baptista, classify Machado as a staunch anti-realist, and argue that his writing attacks Realism, aiming to negate the possibility of representation or the existence of a meaningful objective reality. Realist critics such as John Gledson are more likely to regard Machado's work as a faithful description of Brazilian reality\u2014but one executed with daring innovative technique. In light of Machado's own statements, Daniel argues that Machado's novels represent a growing sophistication and daring in maintaining a dialogue between the aesthetic subjectivism of Romanticism (and its offshoots) and the aesthetic objectivism of Realism-Naturalism. Accordingly, Machado's earlier novels have more in common with a hybrid mid-19th-century current often referred to as \"Romantic Realism.\" In addition, his later novels have more in common with another late 19th-century hybrid: literary Impressionism. Historians such as Sidney Chalhoub argue that Machado's prose constitutes an expos\u00e9 of the social, political and economic dysfunction of late Imperial Brazil. Critics agree on how he used innovative techniques to reveal the contradictions of his society. Roberto Schwarz points out that Machado's innovations in prose narrative are used to expose the hypocrisies, contradictions, and dysfunction of 19th-century Brazil. Schwarz,  argues that Machado inverts many narrative and intellectual conventions to reveal the pernicious ends to which they are used. Thus we see critics reinterpret Machado according to their own designs or their perception of how best to validate him for their own historical moment. Regardless, his incisive prose shines through, able to communicate with readers from different times and places, conveying his ironic and yet tender sense of what we, as human beings, are.Machado's literary style has inspired many Brazilian writers. His works have been adapted to television, theater and cinema. In 1975 the Comiss\u00e3o Machado de Assis (\"Machado de Assis Commission\"), organized by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Culture, organized and published critical editions of Machado's works, in 15 volumes. His main works have been translated into many languages. Great 20th-century writers such as Salman Rushdie, Cabrera Infante and Carlos Fuentes, as well as the American film director Woody Allen, have expressed their enthusiasm for his fiction. Despite the efforts and patronage of such well-known intellectuals as Susan Sontag, Harold Bloom, and Elizabeth Hardwick, Machado's books\u2014the most famous of which are available in English in multiple translations\u2014have never achieved large sales in the English-speaking world and he continues to be relatively unknown, even in comparison with other Latin American writers.\nIn his works, Machado appeals directly to the reader, breaking the so-called fourth wall.\nList of works\n1860 \u2013 Hoje avental, amanh\u00e3 luva (play)\n1861 \u2013 Desencantos (play)\n1863 \u2013 O caminho da porta, and O protocolo (two plays)\n1864 \u2013 Quase ministro (play)\n1864 \u2013 Cris\u00e1lidas (poetry)\n1866 \u2013 Os deuses de casaca (play)\n1870 \u2013 Falenas (poetry)\n1870 \u2013 Contos Fluminenses (collection of short stories)\n1872 \u2013 Ressurrei\u00e7\u00e3o (Resurrection; novel)\n1873 \u2013 Hist\u00f3rias da meia-noite (collection of short stories)\n1874 \u2013 A M\u00e3o e a Luva (The Hand and the Glove; novel)\n1875 \u2013 Americanas (poetry)\n1876 \u2013 Helena (novel)\n1878 \u2013 Iai\u00e1 Garcia (novel)\n1878 \u2013 O bote de rap\u00e9 (play)\n1881 \u2013 Tu, s\u00f3 tu, puro amor (play)\n1881 \u2013 Mem\u00f3rias P\u00f3stumas de Br\u00e1s Cubas (The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas, also known in English as Epitaph of a Small Winner; novel)\n1881 \u2013 O Alienista (The Psychiatrist, or The Alienist; novella)\n1882 \u2013 Pap\u00e9is avulsos (collection of short stories, including \"O Alienista\")\n1884 \u2013 Hist\u00f3rias sem data (collection of short stories)\n1891 \u2013 Quincas Borba (also known in English as Philosopher or Dog?; novel)\n1896 \u2013 V\u00e1rias hist\u00f3rias (collection of short stories)\n1899 \u2013 P\u00e1ginas recolhidas (collection of short stories, including The Case of the Stick and the play N\u00e3o consultes m\u00e9dico)\n1899 \u2013 Dom Casmurro (novel)\n1901 \u2013 Ocidentais (poetry)\n1901 \u2013 Poesias Completas (complete poetry)\n1904 \u2013 Esa\u00fa e Jac\u00f3 (Esau and Jacob; novel)\n1906 \u2013 Li\u00e7\u00e3o de bot\u00e2nica (play)\n1906 \u2013 Rel\u00edquias de Casa Velha (collection of short stories)\n1908 \u2013 Memorial de Aires (Counselor Ayres' Memorial; novel)Posthumous\n\n1910 \u2013 Teatro Coligido (collected plays)\n1910 \u2013 Cr\u00edtica\n1914 \u2013 A Semana (collection of articles)\n1921 \u2013 Outras Rel\u00edquias (collection of short stories)\n1921 \u2013 P\u00e1ginas Escolhidas (collection of short stories)\n1932 \u2013 Novas Rel\u00edquias (collection of short stories)\n1937 \u2013 Cr\u00f4nicas (articles)\n1937 \u2013 Cr\u00edtica Liter\u00e1ria\n1937 \u2013 Cr\u00edtica Teatral\n1937 \u2013 Hist\u00f3rias Rom\u00e2nticas\n1939 \u2013 P\u00e1ginas Esquecidas\n1944 \u2013 Casa Velha\n1956 \u2013 Di\u00e1logos e Reflex\u00f5es de um Relojoeiro\n1958 \u2013 Cr\u00f4nicas de L\u00e9lioTranslations\n\n1861 \u2013 Queda que as mulheres t\u00eam para os tolos, from the original De l'amour des femmes pour les sots, by Victor H\u00e9naux\n1865 \u2013 Supl\u00edcio de uma mulher, from the original Le supplice d'une femme, by \u00c9mile de Girardin\n1866 \u2013 Os Trabalhadores do Mar, from the original Les Travailleurs de la mer, by Victor Hugo\n1870 \u2013 Oliver Twist, from the original Oliver Twist; or, the Parish Boy's Progress, by Charles Dickens\n1883 \u2013 O Corvo, from The Raven, a famous poem by Edgar Allan PoeCollected works\nThere are several published \"Complete Works\" of Machado de Assis:\n\n1920 \u2013 Obras Completas.

His works on Renaissance subjects were popular but controversial in his times.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Stepney in London's East End, Walter Pater was the second son of Richard Glode Pater, a physician who had moved to London in the early 19th century to practice medicine among the poor.  Dr Pater died while Walter was an infant and the family moved to Enfield, London. Walter attended Enfield Grammar School and was individually tutored by the headmaster.\nIn 1853, he was sent to The King's School, Canterbury, where the beauty of the cathedral made an impression that would remain with him all his life. He was fourteen when his mother, Maria Pater, died in 1854.  As a schoolboy Pater read John Ruskin's Modern Painters, which helped inspire his lifelong attraction to the study of art and gave him a taste for well-crafted prose. He gained a school exhibition, with which he proceeded in 1858 to Queen's College, Oxford.As an undergraduate, Pater was a \"reading man\", with literary and philosophical interests beyond the prescribed texts. Flaubert, Gautier, Baudelaire and Swinburne were among his early favourites. Visiting his aunt and sisters in Germany during the vacations, he learned German and began to read Hegel and the German philosophers.  The scholar Benjamin Jowett was struck by his potential and offered to give him private lessons. In Jowett's classes, however, Pater was a disappointment; he took a Second in Literae Humaniores in 1862. As a boy Pater had cherished the idea of entering the Anglican clergy, but at Oxford his faith in Christianity had been shaken. In spite of his inclination towards the ritual and aesthetic elements of the church, he had little interest in Christian doctrine and did not pursue ordination. After graduating, Pater remained in Oxford and taught Classics and Philosophy to private students. His sister Clara Pater, a pioneer of women's education, taught ancient Greek and Latin at Somerville College, of which he was one of the co-founders. His years of study and reading now paid dividends: he was offered a classical fellowship in 1864 at Brasenose on the strength of his ability to teach modern German philosophy, and he settled down to a university career.\n\nCareer and writings\nThe Renaissance\nThe opportunities for wider study and teaching at Oxford, combined with formative visits to the Continent \u2013 in 1865 he visited Florence, Pisa and Ravenna \u2013 meant that Pater's preoccupations now multiplied. He became acutely interested in art and literature, and started to write articles and criticism. First to be printed was an essay on the metaphysics of Coleridge, \"Coleridge's Writings\", contributed anonymously in 1866 to the Westminster Review. A few months later his essay on Winckelmann (1867), an early expression of his intellectual and artistic idealism, appeared in the same review, followed by \"The Poems of William Morris\" (1868), expressing his admiration for romanticism. In the following years the Fortnightly Review printed his essays on Leonardo da Vinci (1869), Sandro Botticelli (1870), and Michelangelo (1871). The last three, with other similar pieces, were collected in his Studies in the History of the Renaissance (1873), renamed in the second and later editions The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry. The Leonardo essay contains Pater's celebrated reverie on the Mona Lisa (\"probably still the most famous piece of writing about any picture in the world\"); the Botticelli essay was the first in English on this painter, contributing to the revival of interest in this artist.  An essay on \"The School of Giorgione\" (Fortnightly Review, 1877), added to the third edition (1888), contains Pater's much-quoted maxim  \"All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music\" (i.e. the arts seek to unify subject-matter and form, and music is the only art in which subject and form are seemingly one). The final paragraphs of the 1868 William Morris essay were reworked as the book's \"Conclusion'.\nThis brief \"Conclusion\" was to be Pater's most influential \u2013 and controversial \u2013 publication. He describes how \"modern thought\" characterizes our physical lives as indistinguishable from scientific processes in perpetual motion, \"renewed from moment to moment but parting sooner or later on their ways\". Pater distances himself from this racy account of sensory flux by attributing it to \"modern thought\", of which he is highly critical. But ironically, and tellingly, Pater was \"repeatedly accused of propounding the very philosophies he meant to expose and combat.\" \"Modern thought\" characterizes the mind as a drift of perceptions, feelings, thoughts and memories, reduced to impressions \"unstable, flickering, inconstant\", \"ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality\"; and \"with the passage and dissolution of impressions... [there is a] continual vanishing away, that strange, perpetual weaving and unweaving of ourselves\". Because all is in flux, to get the most from life, we must learn to discriminate through \"sharp and eager observation\": for \n\nevery moment some form grows perfect in hand or face; some tone on the hills or the sea is choicer than the rest; some mood of passion or insight or intellectual excitement is irresistibly real and attractive for us, \u2013 for that moment only.\nThrough such discrimination we may \"get as many pulsations as possible into the given time\": \"To burn always with this hard, gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life.\" Forming habits means failure on our part, for habit connotes the stereotypical. \"While all melts under our feet,\" Pater wrote, \"we may well catch at any exquisite passion, or any contribution to knowledge that seems by a lifted horizon to set the spirit free for a moment, or any stirring of the senses, or work of the artist's hands. Not to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those about us in the brilliancy of their gifts is, on this short day of frost and sun, to sleep before evening.\" The resulting \"quickened, multiplied consciousness\" counters our insecurity in the face of the flux. Moments of vision may come from simple natural effects, as Pater notes elsewhere in the book: \"A sudden light transfigures a trivial thing, a weathervane, a windmill, a winnowing flail, the dust in the barn door; a moment \u2013 and the thing has vanished, because it was pure effect; but it leaves a relish behind it, a longing that the accident may happen again.\" Or they may come from \"intellectual excitement\", from philosophy, science and the arts. Here we should \"be for ever testing new opinions, never acquiescing in a facile orthodoxy\"; and of these, a passion for the arts, \"a desire of beauty\", has (in the summary of one of Pater's editors) \"the greatest potential for staving off the sense of transience, because in the arts the perceptions of highly sensitive minds are already ordered; we are confronted with a reality already refined and we are able to reach the personality behind the work\".\nThe Renaissance, which appeared to some to endorse amorality and \"hedonism\", provoked criticism from conservative quarters, including disapproval from Pater's former tutor at Queen's College, from the college chaplain at Brasenose College and from the Bishop of Oxford. Margaret Oliphant, reviewing the book in Blackwood's Magazine, dismissed it as \"rococo Epicureanism\", while George Eliot condemned it as \"quite poisonous in its false principles of criticism and false conceptions of life\". In 1874 Pater was turned down at the last moment by his erstwhile mentor Benjamin Jowett, Master of Balliol, for a previously-promised proctorship. In the 1980s, letters emerged documenting a \"romance\" with a nineteen-year-old Balliol undergraduate, William Money Hardinge, who had attracted unfavorable attention as a result of his outspoken homosexuality and blasphemous verse, and who later became a novelist. Many of Pater's works focus on male beauty, friendship and love, either in a Platonic way or, obliquely, in a more physical way. Another undergraduate, W. H. Mallock, had passed the Pater-Hardinge letters to Jowett, who summoned Pater:\n\n\"Pater's whole nature changed under the strain\" (wrote A. C. Benson in his diary) \"after the dreadful interview with Jowett. He became old, crushed, despairing \u2013 and this dreadful weight lasted for years; it was years before he realised that Jowett would not use them.\"\nIn 1876 Mallock parodied Pater's message in a satirical novel The New Republic, depicting Pater as a typically effete English aesthete. The satire appeared during the competition for the Oxford Professorship of Poetry and played a role in convincing Pater to remove himself from consideration. A few months later Pater published what may have been a subtle riposte: \"A Study of Dionysus\" the outsider-god, persecuted for his new religion of ecstasy, who vanquishes the forces of reaction (The Fortnightly Review, Dec. 1876).\nMarius the Epicurean and Imaginary Portraits\nPater was now at the centre of a small but gifted circle in Oxford \u2013 he had tutored Gerard Manley Hopkins in 1866 and the two remained friends till September 1879 when Hopkins left Oxford \u2013 and he was gaining respect in the London literary world and beyond, numbering some of the Pre-Raphaelites among his friends. Conscious of his growing influence and aware that the \"Conclusion\" to his Renaissance could be misconstrued as amoral, he withdrew the essay from the second edition in 1877 (he was to reinstate it with minor modifications in the third in 1888) and now set about clarifying and exemplifying his ideas through fiction.\nTo this end he published in 1878 in Macmillan's Magazine an evocative semi-autobiographical sketch titled \"Imaginary Portraits 1. The Child in the House\", about some of the formative experiences of his childhood \u2013 \"a work\", as Pater's earliest biographer put it, \"which can be recommended to anyone unacquainted with Pater's writings, as exhibiting most fully his characteristic charm.\" This was to be the first of a dozen or so \"Imaginary Portraits\", a genre and term Pater could be said to have invented and in which he came to specialise. These are not so much stories \u2013 plotting is limited and dialogue absent \u2013 as psychological studies of fictional characters in historical settings, often personifications of new concepts at turning-points in the history of ideas or emotion. Some look forward, dealing with innovation in the visual arts and philosophy; others look back, dramatising neo-pagan themes. Many are veiled self-portraits exploring dark personal preoccupations.\nPlanning a major work, Pater now resigned his teaching duties in 1882, though he retained his Fellowship and the college rooms he had occupied since 1864, and made a research visit to Rome.  In his philosophical novel Marius the Epicurean (1885), an extended imaginary portrait set in the Rome of the Antonines, which Pater believed had parallels with his own century, he examines the \"sensations and ideas\" of a young Roman of integrity, who pursues an ideal of the \"aesthetic\" life \u2013 a life based on \u03b1\u1f34\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, sensation \u2013 tempered by asceticism. Leaving behind the religion of his childhood, sampling one philosophy after another, becoming secretary to the Stoic emperor Marcus Aurelius, Marius tests his author's theory of the stimulating effect of the pursuit of sensation and insight as an ideal in itself. The novel's opening and closing episodes betray Pater's continuing nostalgia for the atmosphere, ritual and community of the religious faith he had lost. Marius was favourably reviewed and sold well; a second edition came out in the same year. For the third edition (1892) Pater made extensive stylistic revisions.\nIn 1885, on the resignation of John Ruskin, Pater became a candidate for the Slade Professorship of Fine Art at Oxford University, but though in many ways the strongest of the field, he withdrew from the competition, discouraged by continuing hostility in official quarters. In the wake of this disappointment but buoyed by the success of Marius, he moved with his sisters from North Oxford (2 Bradmore Road), their home since 1869, to London (12 Earls Terrace, Kensington), where he was to live (outside term-time) till 1893 and where he was to enjoy his status of minor literary celebrity.\n\nFrom 1885 to 1887, Pater published four new imaginary portraits in Macmillan's Magazine, each set at a turning-point in the history of ideas or art, and each a study of misfits, men born out of their time, who bring disaster upon themselves \u2013 \"A Prince of Court Painters\" (1885) (on Watteau and Jean-Baptiste Pater), \"Sebastian van Storck\" (1886) (17th-century Dutch society and painting, and the philosophy of Spinoza), \"Denys L'Auxerrois\" (1886) (Dionysus and the medieval cathedral-builders), and \"Duke Carl of Rosenmold\" (1887) (the German Renaissance). These were collected in the volume Imaginary Portraits (1887). Here Pater's examination of the tensions between tradition and innovation, intellect and sensation, asceticism and aestheticism, social mores and amorality, becomes increasingly complex. Implied warnings against the pursuit of extremes in matters intellectual, aesthetic or sensual are unmistakable. The second portrait, \"Sebastian van Storck\", a powerful critique of philosophical solipsism, is perhaps Pater's most striking work of fiction.\n\nAppreciations and Plato and Platonism\nIn 1889 Pater published Appreciations, with an Essay on Style, a collection of previously-printed essays on literature. It was well received. \"Style\" (reprinted from the Fortnightly Review, 1888) is a statement of his creed and methodology as a prose-writer, ending with the paradox \"If style be the man, it will be in a real sense 'impersonal' \". The volume also includes an appraisal of the poems of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, first printed in 1883, a few months after Rossetti's death; \"Aesthetic Poetry\", a revised version of the William Morris essay of 1868 minus its final paragraphs; and an essay on Thomas Browne, whose mystical, Baroque style Pater admired. The essay on Coleridge reprints \"Coleridge's Writings\" (1866) but omits its explicitly anti-Christian passages; it adds paragraphs on Coleridge's poetry that Pater had contributed to T.H. Ward's The English Poets (1880). Pater suppressed, however, in the second edition of Appreciations (1890) the essay \"Aesthetic Poetry\" \u2013 evidence of his growing cautiousness in response to establishment criticism.  All subsequent reprints of Appreciations have followed the second edition.\nIn 1893 Pater and his sisters returned to Oxford (64 St Giles, now the site of  Blackfriars Hall, a Permanent Private Hall of the University of Oxford). He was now in demand as a lecturer. In this year appeared his book Plato and Platonism. Here and in other essays on ancient Greece Pater relates to Greek culture the romanticism-classicism dialectic which he had first explored in his essay \"Romanticism\" (1876), reprinted as the \"Postscript\" to Appreciations. \"All through Greek history,\" he writes, \"we may trace, in every sphere of activity of the Greek mind, the action of these two opposing tendencies, the centrifugal and centripetal.  The centrifugal \u2013 the Ionian, the Asiatic tendency \u2013 flying from the centre, throwing itself forth in endless play of imagination, delighting in brightness and colour, in beautiful material, in changeful form everywhere, its restless versatility driving it towards the development of the individual\": and \"the centripetal tendency\", drawing towards the centre, \"maintaining the Dorian influence of a severe simplification everywhere, in society, in culture\". Harold Bloom noted that \"Pater praises Plato for Classic correctness, for a conservative centripetal impulse, against his [Pater's] own Heraclitean Romanticism,\" but \"we do not believe him when he presents himself as a centripetal man\". The volume, which also includes a sympathetic study of ancient Sparta ('Lacedaemon', 1892), was praised by Jowett.  \"The change that occurs between Marius and Plato and Platonism,\" writes Anthony Ward, \"is one from a sense of defeat in scepticism to a sense of triumph in it.\"\nOn 30 July 1894, Pater died suddenly in his Oxford home of heart failure brought on by rheumatic fever, at the age of 54. He was buried at Holywell Cemetery, Oxford.\nGreek Studies, Miscellaneous Studies and other posthumous volumes\nIn 1895, a friend and former student of Pater's, Charles Lancelot Shadwell, a Fellow and later Provost of Oriel, collected and published as Greek Studies Pater's essays on Greek mythology, religion, art and literature. This volume contains a reverie on the boyhood of Hippolytus, \"Hippolytus Veiled\" (first published in Macmillan's Magazine in 1889), which has been called \"the finest prose ever inspired by Euripides\". The sketch (it is in genre another \"imaginary portrait\") illustrates a paradox central to Pater's sensibility and writings: a leaning towards ascetic beauty apprehended sensuously. The volume also reprints Pater's 1876 \"Study of Dionysus\".\nIn the same year Shadwell assembled other uncollected pieces and published them as Miscellaneous Studies. This volume contains \"The Child in the House\" and another two obliquely self-revelatory Imaginary Portraits, \"Emerald Uthwart\" (first published in The New Review in 1892) and \"Apollo in Picardy\" (from Harper's Magazine, 1893) \u2013 the latter, like \"Denys L'Auxerrois\", centering on a peculiarly Paterian preoccupation: the survival or reincarnation of pagan deities in the Christian era. Also included were Pater's last (unfinished) essay, on Pascal, and two pieces that point to a revival in Pater's final years of his earlier interest in Gothic cathedrals, sparked by regular visits to northern Europe with his sisters. Charles Shadwell \"in his younger days\" had been \"strikingly handsome, both in figure and feature\", \"with a face like those to be seen on the finer Attic coins\"; he had been the unnamed inspiration of an unpublished early paper of Pater's, \"Diaphaneit\u00e8\" (1864), a tribute to youthful beauty and intellect, the manuscript of which Pater gave to Shadwell. This piece Shadwell also included in Miscellaneous Studies. Shadwell had accompanied Pater on his 1865 visit to Italy, and Pater was to dedicate The Renaissance to him and to write a preface to Shadwell's edition of The Purgatory of Dante Alighieri (1892).\nIn 1896 Shadwell edited and published seven chapters of Pater's unfinished novel Gaston de Latour, set in turbulent late 16th-century France, the product of the author's interest in French history, philosophy, literature, and art. Pater had conceived Marius as the first novel of \"a trilogy of works of similar character dealing with the same problems, under altered historical conditions\"; Gaston was to have been the second, while the third was to have been set in England in the late 18th century. In 1995 Gerald Monsman published Gaston de Latour: The Revised Text, re-editing the seven chapters and editing the remaining six which Shadwell had withheld as too unfinished. \"Through the imaginary portrait of Gaston and Gaston's historical contemporaries \u2013 Ronsard, Montaigne, Bruno, Queen Marguerite, King Henry III \u2013 Pater's fantasia confronts and admonishes the Yellow Nineties, Oscar Wilde not least.\" In an 1891 review of The Picture of Dorian Gray in The Bookman, Pater had disapproved of Wilde's distortion of Epicureanism: \"A true Epicureanism aims at a complete though harmonious development of man's entire organism. To lose the moral sense therefore, for instance the sense of sin and righteousness, as Mr. Wilde's heroes are bent on doing so speedily, as completely as they can, is ... to become less complex, to pass from a higher to a lower degree of development.\"Essays from The Guardian (a selection of Pater's book-reviews) and an Uncollected Essays were privately printed in 1896 and 1903 respectively (the latter was republished as Sketches and Reviews in 1919). A Collected Edition of Pater's works, including all but the last volume, was issued in 1901 and was reprinted frequently until the late 1920s.\n\nInfluence\nToward the end of his life Pater's writings were exercising a considerable influence. The principles of what would be known as the Aesthetic Movement were partly traceable to him, and his effect was particularly felt on one of the movement's leading proponents, Oscar Wilde, who paid tribute to him in The Critic as Artist (1891). Among art critics influenced by Pater were Bernard Berenson, Roger Fry, Kenneth Clark and Richard Wollheim: among early literary Modernists, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, W. B. Yeats, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot and Wallace Stevens; and Pater's influence can be traced in the subjective, stream-of-consciousness novels of the early 20th century. In literary criticism, Pater's emphasis on subjectivity and on the autonomy of the reader helped prepare the way for the revolutionary approaches to literary studies of the modern era. Among ordinary readers, idealists have found, and always will find inspiration in his desire \"to burn always with this hard, gemlike flame\", in his pursuit of the \"highest quality\" in \"moments as they pass\". The Paterian sensibility is also apparent in the political philosophy of Michael Oakeshott.\n\nCritical method\nPater's critical method was outlined in the \"Preface\" to The Renaissance (1873) and refined in his later writings. In the \"Preface\", he argues initially for a subjective, relativist response to life, ideas, art, as opposed to the drier, more objective, somewhat moralistic criticism practised by Matthew Arnold and others. \"The first step towards seeing one's object as it really is,\" Pater wrote, \"is to know one's own impression, to discriminate it, to realise it distinctly.  What is this song or picture, this engaging personality in life or in a book, to me?\" When we have formed our impressions we proceed to find \"the power or forces\" which produced them, the work's \"virtue\". \"Pater moves, in other words, from effects to causes, which are his real interest,\" noted Richard Wollheim. Among these causes are, pre-eminently, original temperaments and types of mind; but Pater \"did not confine himself to pairing off a work of art with a particular temperament.  Having a particular temperament under review, he would ask what was the range of forms in which it might find expression. Some of the forms will be metaphysical doctrines, ethical systems, literary theories, religions, myths. Pater's scepticism led him to think that in themselves all such systems lack sense or meaning \u2013 until meaning is conferred upon them by their capacity to give expression to a particular temperament.\"\nTheory, hypothesis, beliefs depend a great deal on temperament; they are, so to speak, mere equivalents of temperament.\nStyle\nPater was much admired for his prose style, which he strove to make worthy of his aesthetic ideals, taking great pains and fastidiously correcting his work. He kept on his desk little squares of paper, each with its ideas, and shuffled them about attempting to form a sequence and pattern. \"I have known writers of every degree, but never one to whom the act of composition was such a travail and an agony as it was to Pater,\" wrote Edmund Gosse, who also described Pater's method of composition: \"So conscious was he of the modifications and additions which would supervene that he always wrote on ruled paper, leaving each alternate line blank.\" He would then make a fair copy and repeat the process, sometimes paying to have drafts printed, to judge their effect. \"Unlike those who were caught by Flaubert's theory of the unique word and the only epithet,\" wrote Osbert Burdett, \"Pater sought the sentence, and the sentence in relation to the paragraph, and the paragraph as a movement in the chapter. The numerous parentheses deliberately exchanged a quick flow of rhythm for pauses, for charming little eddies by the way.\" At the height of his powers as a writer, Pater discussed his principles of composition in the 1888 essay \"Style\". A. C. Benson called Pater's style \"absolutely distinctive and entirely new\", adding, however, that \"it appeals, perhaps, more to the craftsman than to the ordinary reader.\" To G. K. Chesterton, Pater's prose, serene and contemplative in tone, suggested a \"vast attempt at impartiality.\"\nIn literature\nW. Somerset Maugham \u201cThe Magician\u201d (1908) Pater\u2019s essay on the Mona Lisa is quoted by Oliver Haddo in his seduction of Margaret. (Penguin 1967 edition, pp 85-86)\nWilde's Lord Henry Wotton in The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) incessantly and willfully misquotes Pater's Renaissance and Marius.\nPater's The Renaissance is praised as a \"wonderful new volume\" in Edith Wharton's 1920 novel The Age of Innocence, set in the 1870s.\nPater is referred to in W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage at the end of Chapter 41.\nIn Sinclair Lewis's Arrowsmith (chap. 1), Professor Gottlieb tells his medical students (in his accented English), \"Before the next lab hour I shall be glad if you will read Pater's Marius the Epicurean, to derife [sic] from it the calmness which iss [sic] the secret of laboratory skill.\"\nLines from the \"Conclusion\" to Pater's Renaissance are quoted among the sixth formers in Julian Mitchell's 1982 play Another Country.\nPater, with several of his colleagues, appears as a minor character in Tom Stoppard's play The Invention of Love.\nPater is the subject of a poem by Billy Collins titled \"The Great Walter Pater\".\nCitations from Pater's The Renaissance are sprinkled throughout Frederic Tuten's novel The Adventures of Mao on the Long March.\nArthur Conan Doyle uses Pater as a cultural marker in his 1898 novel The Tragedy of the Korosko.  Discussing one of a party steaming up the Nile, he says \u201cMr. Cecil Brown...was a young diplomatist from a Continental Embassy, a man slightly tainted with the Oxford manner, and erring upon the side of unnatural and inhuman refinement, but full of interesting talk and cultured thought...He chose Walter Pater for his travelling author, and sat all day, reserved but affable, under the awning, with his novel and his sketch-book upon a camp-stool beside him.\u201d\nH. L Mencken in his work The American Language mentions Pater twice as a contrast to common English usage in Britain.Bibliography\nPater, Walter (1964),  Brzenk, Eugene J (ed.), Imaginary Portraits: a new collection, NY: Harper.

According to major Zola scholar and biographer Henri Mitterand, \"Naturalism contributes something more than realism: the attention brought to bear on the most lush and opulent aspects of people and the natural world. The realist writer reproduces the object's image impersonally, while the naturalist writer is an artist of temperament.\" He was a major figure in the political liberalization of France and in the exoneration of the falsely accused and convicted army officer Alfred Dreyfus, which is encapsulated in the renowned newspaper headline J'Accuse\u2026! Zola was nominated for the first and second Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901 and 1902.\nEarly life\nZola was born in Paris in 1840 to Fran\u00e7ois Zola (originally Francesco Zolla), and his wife \u00c9milie Aubert. His father was an Italian engineer with some Greek ancestry, who was born in Venice in 1795, and engineered the Zola Dam in Aix-en-Provence; his mother was French. The family moved to Aix-en-Provence in the southeast when \u00c9mile was three years old. Four years later, in 1847, his father died, leaving his mother on a meager pension. In 1858, the Zolas moved to Paris, where \u00c9mile's childhood friend Paul C\u00e9zanne soon joined him. Zola started to write in the romantic style. His widowed mother had planned a law career for \u00c9mile, but he failed his Baccalaur\u00e9at examination twice.Before his breakthrough as a writer, Zola worked for minimal pay as a clerk in a shipping firm and then in the sales department for the publisher (Hachette). He also wrote literary and art reviews for newspapers. As a political journalist, Zola did not hide his dislike of Napoleon III, who had successfully run for the office of president under the constitution of the French Second Republic, only to use this position as a springboard for the coup d'\u00e9tat that made him emperor.\n\nLater life\nIn 1860s, Zola was naturalized as a French citizen. In 1865, he met \u00c9l\u00e9onore-Alexandrine Meley, who called herself Gabrielle, a seamstress, who became his mistress. They married on 31 May 1870. Together they cared for Zola's mother. She stayed with him all his life and was instrumental in promoting his work. The marriage remained childless. Alexandrine Zola had a child before she met Zola that she had given up, because she was unable to take care of it. When she confessed this to Zola after their marriage, they went looking for the girl, but she had died a short time after birth.\nIn 1888, he was given a camera, but he only began to use it in 1895 and attained a near professional level of expertise. Also in 1888, Alexandrine hired Jeanne Rozerot, a seamstress who was to live with them in their home in M\u00e9dan. Zola fell in love with Jeanne and fathered two children with her: Denise in 1889 and Jacques in 1891. After Jeanne left M\u00e9dan for Paris, Zola continued to support and visit her and their children. In November 1891 Alexandrine discovered the affair, which brought the marriage to the brink of divorce. The discord was partially healed, which allowed Zola to take an increasingly active role in the lives of the children. After Zola's death, the children were given his name as their lawful surname.\nCareer\nDuring his early years, Zola wrote numerous short stories and essays, four plays, and three novels. Among his early books was Contes \u00e0 Ninon, published in 1864. With the publication of his sordid autobiographical novel La Confession de Claude (1865) attracting police attention, Hachette fired Zola. His novel Les Myst\u00e8res de Marseille appeared as a serial in 1867. He was also an aggressive critic, his articles on literature and art appearing in Villemessant's journal L'\u00c9v\u00e9nement. After his first major novel, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin (1867), Zola started the series called Les Rougon-Macquart.\nIn Paris, Zola maintained his friendship with C\u00e9zanne, who painted a portrait of him with another friend from Aix-en-Provence, writer Paul Alexis, entitled Paul Alexis Reading to Zola.\n\nLiterary output\nMore than half of Zola's novels were part of the twenty-volume Les Rougon-Macquart cycle, which details the history of a single family under the reign of Napol\u00e9on III. Unlike Balzac, who in the midst of his literary career resynthesized his work into La Com\u00e9die Humaine, Zola from the start, at the age of 28, had thought of the complete layout of the series. Set in France's Second Empire, in the context of Baron Haussmann's changing Paris, the series traces the environmental and hereditary influences of violence, alcohol, and prostitution which became more prevalent during the second wave of the Industrial Revolution. The series examines two branches of the family\u2014the respectable (that is, legitimate) Rougons and the disreputable (illegitimate) Macquarts\u2014over five generations.\nIn the preface to the first novel of the series, Zola states, \"I want to explain how a family, a small group of regular people, behaves in society, while expanding through the birth of ten, twenty individuals, who seem at first glance profoundly dissimilar, but who are shown through analysis to be intimately linked to one another. Heredity has its own laws, just like gravity. I will attempt to find and to follow, by resolving the double question of temperaments and environments, the thread that leads mathematically from one man to another.\"Although Zola and C\u00e9zanne were friends from childhood, they experienced a falling out later in life over Zola's fictionalised depiction of C\u00e9zanne and the Bohemian life of painters in Zola's novel L'\u0152uvre (The Masterpiece, 1886).\nFrom 1877, with the publication of L'Assommoir, \u00c9mile Zola became wealthy; he was better paid than Victor Hugo, for example. Because L'Assommoir was such a success, Zola was able to renegotiate his contract with his publisher Georges Charpentier to receive more than 14% royalties and the exclusive rights to serial publication in the press. Subsequently, sales of L'Assommoir were even exceeded by those of Nana (1880) and La D\u00e9b\u00e2cle (1892). He became a figurehead among the literary bourgeoisie and organised cultural dinners with Guy de Maupassant, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and other writers at his luxurious villa (worth 300,000 francs) in M\u00e9dan, near Paris, after 1880. Despite being nominated several times, Zola was never elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.Zola's output also included novels on population (F\u00e9condit\u00e9) and work (Travail), a number of plays, and several volumes of criticism. He wrote every day for around 30 years, and took as his motto Nulla dies sine linea (\"not a day without a line\").\nThe self-proclaimed leader of French naturalism, Zola's works inspired operas such as those of Gustave Charpentier, notably Louise in the 1890s. His works, inspired by the concept of heredity and milieu (Claude Bernard and Hippolyte Taine) and by the realism of Balzac and Flaubert. He also provided the libretto for several operas by Alfred Bruneau, including Messidor (1897) and L'Ouragan (1901); several of Bruneau's other operas are adapted from Zola's writing. These provided a French alternative to Italian verismo.He is considered to be a significant influence on those writers that are credited with the creation of the so-called new journalism; Wolfe, Capote, Thompson, Mailer, Didion, Talese and others.\nTom Wolfe wrote that his goal in writing fiction was to document contemporary society in the tradition of John Steinbeck, Charles Dickens, and \u00c9mile Zola.\nDreyfus affair\nCaptain Alfred Dreyfus was a French-Jewish artillery officer in the French army. In September 1894, French intelligence found information about someone giving the German Embassy military secrets. Anti-semitism caused senior officers to suspect Dreyfus, though there was no direct evidence of any wrongdoing. Dreyfus was court-martialed, convicted of treason, and sent to Devil's Island in French Guiana.\nLt. Col. Georges Picquart came across evidence that implicated another officer, Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy, and informed his superiors. Rather than move to clear Dreyfus, the decision was made to protect Esterhazy and ensure the original verdict was not overturned. Major Hubert-Joseph Henry forged documents that made it seem as if Dreyfus were guilty, while Picquart was reassigned to duty in Africa. However, Picquart's findings were communicated by his lawyer to the Senator Auguste Scheurer-Kestner, who took up the case, at first discreetly and then increasingly publicly. Meanwhile, further evidence was brought forward by Dreyfus's family and Esterhazy's estranged family and creditors. Under pressure, the general staff arranged for a closed court-martial to be held on 10\u201311 January 1898, at which Esterhazy was tried in camera and acquitted. Picquart was detained on charges of violation of professional secrecy.\nIn response Zola risked his career and more, and on 13 January 1898 published J'Accuse\u2026! on the front page of the Paris daily L'Aurore. The newspaper was run by Ernest Vaughan and Georges Clemenceau, who decided that the controversial story would be in the form of an open letter to the President, F\u00e9lix Faure. Zola's J'Accuse...! accused the highest levels of the French Army of obstruction of justice and antisemitism by having wrongfully convicted Alfred Dreyfus to life imprisonment on Devil's Island. Zola's intention was that he be prosecuted for libel so that the new evidence in support of Dreyfus would be made public. The case, known as the Dreyfus affair, deeply divided France between the reactionary army and Catholic church on one hand, and the more liberal commercial society on the other. The ramifications continued for many years; on the 100th anniversary of Zola's article, France's Roman Catholic daily paper, La Croix, apologised for its antisemitic editorials during the Dreyfus affair. As Zola was a leading French thinker and public figure, his letter formed a major turning point in the affair.Zola was brought to trial for criminal libel on 7 February 1898, and was convicted on 23 February and removed from the Legion of Honour. The first judgment was overturned in April on a technicality, but a new suit was pressed against Zola, which opened on 18 July. At his lawyer's advice, Zola fled to England rather than wait for the end of the trial (at which he was again convicted). Without even having had the time to pack a few clothes, he arrived at Victoria Station on 19 July, the start of a brief and unhappy residence in the UK. After initially staying at the Grosvenor Hotel, Victoria, Zola then went to the Oatlands Park Hotel in Weybridge and shortly afterwards rented a house locally called Penn where he was joined by his family for the summer. At the end of August, they moved to another house in Addlestone called Summerfield. In early October the family moved to London and then his wife and children went back to France so the children could resume their schooling. Thereafter Zola lived alone in the Queen's Hotel, Norwood. He stayed in Upper Norwood from October 1898 to June 1899.In France, the furious divisions over the Dreyfus affair continued. The fact of Major Henry's forgery was discovered and admitted to in August 1898, and the Government referred Dreyfus's original court-martial to the Supreme Court for review the following month, over the objections of the General Staff. Eight months later, on 3 June 1899, the Supreme Court annulled the original verdict and ordered a new military court-martial. The same month Zola returned from his exile in England. Still the anti-Dreyfusards would not give up, and on 8 September 1899 Dreyfus was again convicted. Dreyfus applied for a retrial, but the government countered by offering Dreyfus a pardon (rather than exoneration), which would allow him to go free, provided that he admit to being guilty. Although he was clearly not guilty, he chose to accept the pardon. Later the same month, despite Zola's condemnation, an amnesty bill was passed, covering \"all criminal acts or misdemeanours related to the Dreyfus affair or that have been included in a prosecution for one of these acts\", indemnifying Zola and Picquart, but also all those who had concocted evidence against Dreyfus. Dreyfus was finally completely exonerated by the Supreme Court in 1906.Zola said of the affair, \"The truth is on the march, and nothing shall stop it.\" \nZola's 1898 article is widely marked in France as the most prominent manifestation of the new power of the intellectuals (writers, artists, academicians) in shaping public opinion, the media and the state.\nThe Manifesto of the Five\nOn August 18, 1887, the French daily newspaper Le Figaro published \"The Manifesto of the Five\" shortly after La Terre was released. The signatories included Paul Bonnetain, J. H. Rosny, Lucien Descaves, Paul Margueritte and Gustave Guiches, who strongly disapproved of the lack of balance of both morals and aesthetics throughout the book's depiction of the revolution. The manifesto accused Zola of having \"lowered the standard of Naturalism, of catering to large sales by deliberate obscenities, of being a morbid and impotent hypochondriac, incapable of taking a sane and healthy view of mankind. They freely referred to Zola's physiological weaknesses and expressed the utmost horror at the crudeness of La Terre.\"\nDeath\nZola died on 29 September 1902 of carbon monoxide poisoning caused by an improperly ventilated chimney. His funeral on 5 October was attended by thousands. Alfred Dreyfus initially had promised not to attend the funeral, but was given permission by Mme Zola and attended. At the time of his death Zola had just completed a novel, V\u00e9rit\u00e9, about the Dreyfus trial. A sequel, Justice, had been planned, but was not completed.\nHis enemies were blamed for his death because of previous attempts on his life, but nothing could be proved at the time. Expressions of sympathy arrived from everywhere in France; for a week the vestibule of his house was crowded with notable writers, scientists, artists, and politicians who came to inscribe their names in the registers. On the other hand, Zola's enemies used the opportunity to celebrate in malicious glee. Writing in L'Intransigeant, Henri Rochefort claimed Zola had committed suicide, having discovered Dreyfus to be guilty.\nZola was initially buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Montmartre in Paris, but on 4 June 1908, just five years and nine months after his death, his remains were relocated to the Panth\u00e9on, where he shares a crypt with Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. The ceremony was disrupted by an assassination attempt by Louis-Anthelme Gr\u00e9gori, a disgruntled journalist and admirer of Edouard Drumont, on Alfred Dreyfus, who was wounded in the arm by the gunshot. Gr\u00e9gori was acquitted by the Parisian court which accepted his defense that he had not meant to kill Dreyfus, meaning merely to graze him.\nIn 1953, an investigation (\"Zola a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 assassin\u00e9?\") published by the journalist Jean Borel in the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration raised the idea that Zola's death might have been a murder rather than an accident. It is based on the revelation of the Norman pharmacist Pierre Hacquin, who was told by the chimney-sweep Henri Buronfosse that the latter intentionally blocked the chimney of Zola's apartment in Paris (\"Hacquin, je vais vous dire comment Zola est mort. [...] Zola a \u00e9t\u00e9 asphyxi\u00e9 volontairement. C'est nous qui avons bouch\u00e9 la chemin\u00e9e de son appartement.\").\nScope of the Rougon-Macquart series\nZola's Rougon-Macquart novels are a panoramic account of the Second French Empire. They tell the story of a family approximately between the years 1851 and 1871. These twenty novels contain over 300 characters, who descend from the two family lines of the Rougons and Macquarts. In Zola's words, which are the subtitle of the Rougon-Macquart series, they are \"L'Histoire naturelle et sociale d'une famille sous le Second Empire\" (\"The natural and social history of a family under the Second Empire\").\nMost of the Rougon-Macquart novels were written during the French Third Republic. To an extent, attitudes and value judgments may have been superimposed on that picture with the wisdom of hindsight. Some critics classify Zola's work, and naturalism more broadly, as a particular strain of decadent literature, which emphasized the fallen, corrupted state of modern civilization. Nowhere is the doom-laden image of the Second Empire so clearly seen as in Nana, which culminates in echoes of the Franco-Prussian War (and hence by implication of the French defeat). Even in novels dealing with earlier periods of Napoleon III's reign the picture of the Second Empire is sometimes overlaid with the imagery of catastrophe.In the Rougon-Macquart novels, provincial life can seem to be overshadowed by Zola's preoccupation with the capital.. However, the following novels (see the individual titles in the Livre de poche series) scarcely touch on life in Paris: La Terre (peasant life in Beauce), Le R\u00eave (an unnamed cathedral city), Germinal (collieries in the northeast of France), La Joie de vivre (the Atlantic coast), and the four novels set in and around Plassans (modelled on his childhood home, Aix-en-Provence), (La Fortune des Rougon, La Conqu\u00eate de Plassans, La Faute de l'Abb\u00e9 Mouret and Le Docteur Pascal). La D\u00e9b\u00e2cle, the military novel is set for the most part in country districts of eastern France; its d\u00e9nouement takes place in the capital during the civil war leading to the suppression of the Paris Commune. Though Paris has its role in La B\u00eate humaine the most striking incidents (notably the train crash) take place elsewhere. Even the Paris-centred novels tend to set some scenes outside, if not very far from, the capital. In the political novel Son Excellence Eug\u00e8ne Rougon, the eponymous minister's interventions on behalf of his so-called friends, have their consequences elsewhere, and the reader is witness to some of them. Even Nana, one of Zola's characters most strongly associated with Paris, makes a brief and typically disastrous trip to the country.\nQuasi-scientific purpose\nIn Le Roman exp\u00e9rimental and Les Romanciers naturalistes, Zola expounded the purposes of the \"naturalist\" novel. The experimental novel was to serve as a vehicle for scientific experiment, analogous to the experiments conducted by Claude Bernard and expounded by him in Introduction \u00e0 la m\u00e9decine exp\u00e9rimentale. Claude Bernard's experiments were in the field of clinical physiology, those of the Naturalist writers (Zola being their leader) would be in the realm of psychology influenced by the natural environment. Balzac, Zola claimed, had already investigated the psychology of lechery in an experimental manner, in the figure of Hector Hulot in La Cousine Bette. Essential to Zola's concept of the experimental novel was dispassionate observation of the world, with all that it involved by way of meticulous documentation. To him, each novel should be based upon a dossier.With this aim, he visited the colliery of Anzin in northern France, in February 1884 when a strike was on; he visited La Beauce (for La Terre), Sedan, Ardennes (for La D\u00e9b\u00e2cle) and travelled on the railway line between Paris and Le Havre (when researching La B\u00eate humaine).\nCharacterisation\nZola strongly claimed that Naturalist literature is an experimental analysis of human psychology. Considering this claim, many critics, such as Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs, find Zola strangely poor at creating lifelike and memorable characters in the manner of Honor\u00e9 de Balzac or Charles Dickens, despite his ability to evoke powerful crowd scenes. It was important to Zola that no character should appear larger than life; but the criticism that his characters are \"cardboard\" is substantially more damaging. Zola, by refusing to make any of his characters larger than life (if that is what he has indeed done), did not inhibit himself from also achieving verisimilitude.\nAlthough Zola found it scientifically and artistically unjustifiable to create larger-than-life characters, his work presents some larger-than-life symbols which, like the mine Le Voreux in Germinal, take on the nature of a surrogate human life. The mine, the still in L'Assommoir and the locomotive La Lison in La B\u00eate humaine impress the reader with the vivid reality of human beings. The great natural processes of seedtime and harvest, death and renewal in La Terre are instinct with a vitality which is not human but is the elemental energy of life. Human life is raised to the level of the mythical as the hammerblows of Titans are seemingly heard underground at Le Voreux or in La Faute de l'Abb\u00e9 Mouret, the walled park of Le Paradou encloses a re-enactment\u2014and restatement\u2014of the Book of Genesis.\nZola's optimism\nIn Zola there is the theorist and the writer, the poet, the scientist and the optimist \u2013 features that are basically joined together in his own confession of positivism; later in his life, when he saw his own position turning into an anachronism, he would still style himself with irony and sadness over the lost cause as \"an old and rugged Positivist\".The poet is the artist in words whose writing, as in the racecourse scene in Nana or in the descriptions of the laundry in L'Assommoir or in many passages of La Faute de l'Abb\u00e9 Mouret, Le Ventre de Paris and La Cur\u00e9e, vies with the colourful impressionistic techniques of Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The scientist is a believer in some measure of scientific determinism \u2013 not that this, despite his own words \"devoid of free will\" (\"d\u00e9pourvus de libre arbitre\"), need always amount to a philosophical denial of free will. The creator of \"la litt\u00e9rature putride\", a term of abuse invented by an early critic of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin (a novel which predates Les Rougon-Macquart series), emphasizes the squalid aspects of the human environment and upon the seamy side of human nature.The optimist is that other face of the scientific experimenter, the man with an unshakable belief in human progress. Zola bases his optimism on inn\u00e9it\u00e9 and on the supposed capacity of the human race to make progress in a moral sense. Inn\u00e9it\u00e9 is defined by Zola as that process in which \"se confondent les caract\u00e8res physiques et moraux des parents, sans que rien d'eux semble s'y retrouver\"; it is the term used in biology to describe the process whereby the moral and temperamental dispositions of some individuals are unaffected by the hereditary transmission of genetic characteristics. Jean Macquart and Pascal Rougon are two instances of individuals liberated from the blemishes of their ancestors by the operation of the process of inn\u00e9it\u00e9.\nIn popular culture\nThe Life of Emile Zola (1937) is a well received film biography, starring Paul Muni, that devotes significant footage to detailing Zola's involvement in exonerating Dreyfus. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nZola is known to have been an inspiration to Christopher Hitchens as found in his book Letters to a Young Contrarian (2001).\nThe 2012 BBC TV series, The Paradise, is based on Zola's 1883 novel Au Bonheur des Dames.\nC\u00e9zanne et Moi (2016) is a French film, directed by Dani\u00e8le Thompson, that explores the friendship between Zola and the Post-Impressionist painter Paul C\u00e9zanne.\nZola is referenced as an important cultural figure in the Korean Drama SKY Castle (2018)Bibliography\nFrench language\nWorks translated into English\nThe Three Cities Trilogy\nThe Three Cities Trilogy: Lourdes,\nThe Three Cities Trilogy: Rome\nThe Three Cities Trilogy: Paris\nFruitfulness\nTheresa Raquin (1867)\nThe Fortune of the Rougons (1871)\nAbbe Mouret's Transgression (1875)\nL'Assommoir (1876)\nThe Flood (1880)\nGerminal (1885)\nThe Rush for the Spoil (La Curee, 1886)\nPiping Hot!

He is regarded as a key transitional figure between literary realism and literary modernism and is considered by many to be among the greatest novelists in the English language. He was the son of Henry James Sr. and the brother of renowned philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James.\nHe is best known for a number of novels dealing with the social and marital interplay between \u00e9migr\u00e9 Americans, English people, and continental Europeans. Examples of such novels include The Portrait of a Lady, The Ambassadors, and The Wings of the Dove. His later works were increasingly experimental. In describing the internal states of mind and social dynamics of his characters, James often made use of a style in which ambiguous or contradictory motives and impressions were overlaid or juxtaposed in the discussion of a character's psyche. For their unique ambiguity, as well as for other aspects of their composition, his late works have been compared to impressionist painting.\nHis novella The Turn of the Screw has garnered a reputation as the most analysed and ambiguous ghost story in the English language and remains his most widely adapted work in other media. He also wrote a number of other highly regarded ghost stories and is considered one of the greatest masters of the field.\nJames published articles and books of criticism, travel, biography, autobiography, and plays. Born in the United States, James largely relocated to Europe as a young man and eventually settled in England, becoming a British citizen in 1915, one year before his death. James was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911, 1912 and 1916.\nLife\nEarly years, 1843\u20131883\nJames was born at 21 Washington Place in New York City on 15 April 1843. His parents were Mary Walsh and Henry James Sr. His father was intelligent and steadfastly congenial. He was a lecturer and philosopher who had inherited independent means from his father, an Albany banker and investor. Mary came from a wealthy family long settled in New York City. Her sister Katherine lived with her adult family for an extended period of time. Henry Jr. was one of four boys, the others being William, who was one year his senior, and younger brothers Wilkinson (Wilkie) and Robertson. His younger sister was Alice. Both of his parents were of Irish and Scottish descent.Before he was a year old, his father sold the house at Washington Place and took the family to Europe, where they lived for a time in a cottage in Windsor Great Park in England. The family returned to New York in 1845, and Henry spent much of his childhood living between his paternal grandmother's home in Albany, and a house on 14th Street in Manhattan. His education was calculated by his father to expose him to many influences, primarily scientific and philosophical; it was described by Percy Lubbock, the editor of his selected letters, as \"extraordinarily haphazard and promiscuous.\" James did not share the usual education in Latin and Greek classics. Between 1855 and 1860, the James household travelled to London, Paris, Geneva, Boulogne-sur-Mer and Newport, Rhode Island, according to the father's current interests and publishing ventures, retreating to the United States when funds were low. Henry studied primarily with tutors and briefly attended schools while the family travelled in Europe. Their longest stays were in France, where Henry began to feel at home and became fluent in French. He had a stutter, which seems to have manifested itself only when he spoke English; in French, he did not stutter.\nIn 1860 the family returned to Newport. There Henry became a friend of the painter John La Farge, who introduced him to French literature, and in particular, to Balzac. James later called Balzac his \"greatest master,\" and said that he had learned more about the craft of fiction from him than from anyone else.In the autumn of 1861 Henry received an injury, probably to his back, while fighting a fire. This injury, which resurfaced at times throughout his life, made him unfit for military service in the American Civil War.In 1864 the James family moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to be near William, who had enrolled first in the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard and then in the medical school. In 1862 Henry attended Harvard Law School, but realised that he was not interested in studying law. He pursued his interest in literature and associated with authors and critics William Dean Howells and Charles Eliot Norton in Boston and Cambridge, formed lifelong friendships with Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the future Supreme Court Justice, and with James T. Fields and Annie Adams Fields, his first professional mentors.\nHis first published work was a review of a stage performance, \"Miss Maggie Mitchell in Fanchon the Cricket,\" published in 1863. About a year later, A Tragedy of Error, his first short story, was published anonymously. James's first payment was for an appreciation of Sir Walter Scott's novels, written for the North American Review. He wrote fiction and non-fiction pieces for The Nation and Atlantic Monthly, where Fields was editor. In 1871 he published his first novel, Watch and Ward, in serial form in the Atlantic Monthly. The novel was later published in book form in 1878.\nDuring a 14-month trip through Europe in 1869\u201370, he met Ruskin, Dickens, Matthew Arnold, William Morris, and George Eliot. Rome impressed him profoundly. \"Here I am then in the Eternal City,\" he wrote to his brother William. \"At last\u2014for the first time\u2014I live!\" He attempted to support himself as a freelance writer in Rome, then secured a position as Paris correspondent for the New York Tribune, through the influence of its editor John Hay. When these efforts failed, he returned to New York City. During 1874 and 1875 he published Transatlantic Sketches, A Passionate Pilgrim, and Roderick Hudson. During this early period in his career he was influenced by Nathaniel Hawthorne.In 1869 he settled in London. There he established relationships with Macmillan and other publishers, who paid for serial installments that they would later publish in book form. The audience for these serialized novels was largely made up of middle-class women, and James struggled to fashion serious literary work within the strictures imposed by editors' and publishers' notions of what was suitable for young women to read. He lived in rented rooms but was able to join gentlemen's clubs that had libraries and where he could entertain male friends. He was introduced to English society by Henry Adams and Charles Milnes Gaskell, the latter introducing him to the Travellers' and the Reform Clubs.In the fall of 1875, he moved to the Latin Quarter of Paris. Aside from two trips to America, he spent the next three decades\u2014the rest of his life\u2014in Europe. In Paris he met Zola, Alphonse Daudet, Maupassant, Turgenev, and others. He stayed in Paris only a year before moving to London.\nIn England he met the leading figures of politics and culture. He continued to be a prolific writer, producing The American (1877), The Europeans (1878), a revision of Watch and Ward (1878), French Poets and Novelists (1878), Hawthorne (1879), and several shorter works of fiction. In 1878 Daisy Miller established his fame on both sides of the Atlantic. It drew notice perhaps mostly because it depicted a woman whose behavior is outside the social norms of Europe. He also began his first masterpiece, The Portrait of a Lady, which would appear in 1881.\nIn 1877 he first visited Wenlock Abbey in Shropshire, home of his friend Charles Milnes Gaskell whom he had met through Henry Adams. He was much inspired by the darkly romantic Abbey and the surrounding countryside, which features in his essay \u201cAbbeys and Castles.\u201d In particular, the gloomy monastic fishponds behind the Abbey are said to have inspired the lake in The Turn of the Screw.While living in London, James continued to follow the careers of the French realists, \u00c9mile Zola in particular. Their stylistic methods influenced his own work in the years to come. Hawthorne's influence on him faded during this period, replaced by George Eliot and Ivan Turgenev. The period from 1878 to 1881 saw the publication of The Europeans, Washington Square, Confidence, and The Portrait of a Lady.\nThe period from 1882 to 1883 was marked by several losses. His mother died in January 1882, while James was in Washington D.C. on an extended visit to America. He returned to his parents' home in Cambridge, where he was together with all four of his siblings for the first time in 15 years. He returned to Europe in mid-1882, but was back in America by the end of the year following the death of his father. Emerson, an old family friend, died in 1882. His brother Wilkie and friend Turgenev both died in 1883.\n\nMiddle years, 1884\u20131897\nIn 1884 James made another visit to Paris. There he met again with Zola, Daudet, and Goncourt. He had been following the careers of the French \"realist\" or \"naturalist\" writers, and was increasingly influenced by them. In 1886, he published The Bostonians and The Princess Casamassima, both influenced by the French writers he'd studied assiduously. Critical reaction and sales were poor. He wrote to Howells that the books had hurt his career rather than helped because they had \"reduced the desire, and demand, for my productions to zero.\u201d During this time he became friends with Robert Louis Stevenson, John Singer Sargent, Edmund Gosse, George du Maurier, Paul Bourget, and Constance Fenimore Woolson. His third novel from the 1880s was The Tragic Muse. Although he was following the precepts of Zola in his novels of the '80s, their tone and attitude are closer to the fiction of Alphonse Daudet. The lack of critical and financial success for his novels during this period led him to try writing for the theatre; His dramatic works and his experiences with theatre are discussed below.\nIn the last quarter of 1889, \"for pure and copious lucre,\" he started translating Port Tarascon, the third volume of Alphonse Daudet's adventures of Tartarin de Tarascon. Serialized in Harper's Monthly Magazine from June 1890, this translation \u2013 praised as \"clever\" by The Spectator \u2013 was published in January 1891 by Sampson Low, Marston, Searle & Rivington.\nAfter the stage failure of Guy Domville in 1895, James was near despair and thoughts of death plagued him. His depression was compounded by the deaths of those closest to him, including his sister Alice in 1892; his friend Wolcott Balestier in 1891; and Stevenson and Fenimore Woolson in 1894. The sudden death of Fenimore Woolson in January 1894, and the speculations of suicide surrounding her death, were particularly painful for him. Leon Edel wrote that the reverberations from Fenimore Woolson's death were such that \"we can read a strong element of guilt and bewilderment in his letters, and, even more, in those extraordinary tales of the next half-dozen years, \"The Altar of the Dead\" and \"The Beast in the Jungle\".\"The years spent on dramatic works were not entirely a loss. As he moved into the last phase of his career, he found ways to adapt dramatic techniques into the novel form.\nIn the late 1880s and throughout the 1890s, James made several trips through Europe. He spent a long stay in Italy in 1887. In that year he published the short novel The Aspern Papers and The Reverberator.\nLate years, 1898\u20131916\nIn 1897\u20131898 he moved to Rye, Sussex and wrote The Turn of the Screw. 1899\u20131900 saw the publication of The Awkward Age and The Sacred Fount. During 1902\u20131904 he wrote The Ambassadors, The Wings of the Dove, and The Golden Bowl.\nIn 1904 he revisited America and lectured on Balzac. In 1906\u20131910 he published The American Scene and edited the \"New York Edition\", a 24-volume collection of his works. In 1910 his brother William died; Henry had just joined William from an unsuccessful search for relief in Europe on what then turned out to be his (Henry's) last visit to the United States (from summer 1910 to July 1911) and was near him according to a letter he wrote when he died.In 1913 he wrote his autobiographies, A Small Boy and Others, and Notes of a Son and Brother. After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, he did war work. In 1915 he became a British citizen and was awarded the Order of Merit the following year. He died on 28 February 1916, in Chelsea, London, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. As he requested, his ashes were buried in Cambridge Cemetery in Massachusetts.\nSexuality\nJames regularly rejected suggestions that he should marry, and after settling in London, proclaimed himself \"a bachelor\". F. W. Dupee, in several volumes on the James family, originated the theory that he had been in love with his cousin, Mary (\"Minnie\") Temple, but that a neurotic fear of sex kept him from admitting such affections: \"James's invalidism\u00a0... was itself the symptom of some fear of or scruple against sexual love on his part.\" Dupee used an episode from James's memoir, A Small Boy and Others, recounting a dream of a Napoleonic image in the Louvre, to exemplify James's romanticism about Europe, a Napoleonic fantasy into which he fled.Between 1953 and 1972, Leon Edel wrote a major five-volume biography of James, which accessed unpublished letters and documents after Edel gained the permission of James's family. Edel's portrayal of James included the suggestion he was celibate. It was a view first propounded by critic Saul Rosenzweig in 1943. In 1996 Sheldon M. Novick published Henry James: The Young Master, followed by Henry James: The Mature Master (2007). The first book \"caused something of an uproar in Jamesian circles\" as it challenged the previous received notion of celibacy, a once-familiar paradigm in biographies of homosexuals when direct evidence was non-existent. Novick also criticized Edel for following the discounted Freudian interpretation of homosexuality \"as a kind of failure.\" The difference of opinion erupted in a series of exchanges between Edel and Novick which were published by the online magazine Slate, with the latter arguing that even the suggestion of celibacy went against James's own injunction \"live!\"\u2014not \"fantasize!\"A letter James wrote in old age to Hugh Walpole has been cited as an explicit statement of this. Walpole confessed to him of indulging in \"high jinks\", and James wrote a reply endorsing it: \"We must know, as much as possible, in our beautiful art, yours & mine, what we are talking about \u2014 & the only way to know it is to have lived & loved & cursed & floundered & enjoyed & suffered \u2014 I don't think I regret a single \u2018excess\u2019 of my responsive youth\".The interpretation of James as living a less austere emotional life has been subsequently explored by other scholars. The often intense politics of Jamesian scholarship has also been the subject of studies. Author Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn has said that Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's Epistemology of the Closet made a landmark difference to Jamesian scholarship by arguing that he be read as a homosexual writer whose desire to keep his sexuality a secret shaped his layered style and dramatic artistry. According to T\u00f3ib\u00edn such a reading \"removed James from the realm of dead white males who wrote about posh people. He became our contemporary.\"James's letters to expatriate American sculptor Hendrik Christian Andersen have attracted particular attention. James met the 27-year-old Andersen in Rome in 1899, when James was 56, and wrote letters to Andersen that are intensely emotional: \"I hold you, dearest boy, in my innermost love, & count on your feeling me\u2014in every throb of your soul\". In a letter of 6 May 1904, to his brother William, James referred to himself as \"always your hopelessly celibate even though sexagenarian Henry\". How accurate that description might have been is the subject of contention among James's biographers, but the letters to Andersen were occasionally quasi-erotic: \"I put, my dear boy, my arm around you, & feel the pulsation, thereby, as it were, of our excellent future & your admirable endowment.\"His numerous letters to the many young homosexual men among his close male friends are more forthcoming. To his homosexual friend, Howard Sturgis, James could write: \"I repeat, almost to indiscretion, that I could live with you. Meanwhile, I can only try to live without you.\" In another letter to Howard Sturgis, following a long visit, James refers jocularly to their \"happy little congress of two\". In letters to Hugh Walpole he pursues convoluted jokes and puns about their relationship, referring to himself as an elephant who \"paws you oh so benevolently\" and winds about Walpole his \"well meaning old trunk\". His letters to Walter Berry printed by the Black Sun Press have long been celebrated for their lightly veiled eroticism.However, James corresponded in equally extravagant language with his many female friends, writing, for example, to fellow novelist Lucy Clifford: \"Dearest Lucy! What shall I say? when I love you so very, very much, and see you nine times for once that I see Others! Therefore I think that \u2014 if you want it made clear to the meanest intelligence \u2014 I love you more than I love Others.\" To his New York friend Mary Cadwalader Rawle Jones: \"Dearest Mary Cadwalader. I yearn over you, but I yearn in vain; & your long silence really breaks my heart, mystifies, depresses, almost alarms me, to the point even of making me wonder if poor unconscious & doting old C\u00e9limare [Jones's pet name for James] has 'done' anything, in some dark somnambulism of the spirit, which has\u00a0... given you a bad moment, or a wrong impression, or a 'colourable pretext'\u00a0... However these things may be, he loves you as tenderly as ever; nothing, to the end of time, will ever detach him from you, & he remembers those Eleventh St. matutinal intimes hours, those telephonic matin\u00e9es, as the most romantic of his life\u00a0...\" His long friendship with American novelist, Constance Fenimore Woolson, in whose house he lived for a number of weeks in Italy in 1887, and his shock and grief over her suicide in 1894, are discussed in detail in Edel's biography and play a central role in a study by Lyndall Gordon. Edel conjectured that Woolson was in love with James and killed herself in part because of his coldness, but Woolson's biographers have objected to Edel's account.\nWorks\nStyle and themes\nJames is one of the major figures of trans-Atlantic literature. His works frequently juxtapose characters from the Old World (Europe), embodying a feudal civilisation that is beautiful, often corrupt, and alluring, and from the New World (United States), where people are often brash, open, and assertive and embody the virtues of the new American society \u2014 particularly personal freedom and a more highly evolved moral character. James explores this clash of personalities and cultures, in stories of personal relationships in which power is exercised well or badly.\nHis protagonists were often young American women facing oppression or abuse, and as his secretary Theodora Bosanquet remarked in her monograph Henry James at Work:\n\nWhen he walked out of the refuge of his study and into the world and looked around him, he saw a place of torment, where creatures of prey perpetually thrust their claws into the quivering flesh of doomed, defenseless children of light\u00a0... His novels are a repeated exposure of this wickedness, a reiterated and passionate plea for the fullest freedom of development, unimperiled by reckless and barbarous stupidity.\nPhilip Guedalla jokingly described three phases in the development of James's prose: \"James I, James II, and The Old Pretender,\" and observers do often group his works of fiction into three periods. In his apprentice years, culminating with the masterwork The Portrait of a Lady, his style was simple and direct (by the standards of Victorian magazine writing) and he experimented widely with forms and methods, generally narrating from a conventionally omniscient point of view. Plots generally concern romance, except for the three big novels of social commentary that conclude this period. In the second period, as noted above, he abandoned the serialized novel and from 1890 to about 1897, he wrote short stories and plays. Finally, in his third and last period he returned to the long, serialised novel. Beginning in the second period, but most noticeably in the third, he increasingly abandoned direct statement in favour of frequent double negatives, and complex descriptive imagery. Single paragraphs began to run for page after page, in which an initial noun would be succeeded by pronouns surrounded by clouds of adjectives and prepositional clauses, far from their original referents, and verbs would be deferred and then preceded by a series of adverbs. The overall effect could be a vivid evocation of a scene as perceived by a sensitive observer. It has been debated whether this change of style was engendered by James's shifting from writing to dictating to a typist, a change made during the composition of What Maisie Knew.In its intense focus on the consciousness of his major characters, James's later work foreshadows extensive developments in 20th century fiction. Indeed, he might have influenced stream-of-consciousness writers such as Virginia Woolf, who not only read some of his novels but also wrote essays about them. Both contemporary and modern readers have found the late style difficult and unnecessary; his friend Edith Wharton, who admired him greatly, said that there were passages in his work that were all but incomprehensible. James was harshly portrayed by H.\u00a0G. Wells as a hippopotamus laboriously attempting to pick up a pea that had got into a corner of its cage. The \"late James\" style was ably parodied by Max Beerbohm in \"The Mote in the Middle Distance\".More important for his work overall may have been his position as an expatriate, and in other ways an outsider, living in Europe. While he came from middle-class and provincial beginnings (seen from the perspective of European polite society) he worked very hard to gain access to all levels of society, and the settings of his fiction range from working class to aristocratic, and often describe the efforts of middle-class Americans to make their way in European capitals. He confessed he got some of his best story ideas from gossip at the dinner table or at country house weekends. He worked for a living, however, and lacked the experiences of select schools, university, and army service, the common bonds of masculine society. He was furthermore a man whose tastes and interests were, according to the prevailing standards of Victorian era Anglo-American culture, rather feminine, and who was shadowed by the cloud of prejudice that then and later accompanied suspicions of his homosexuality. Edmund Wilson famously compared James's objectivity to Shakespeare's:\n\nOne would be in a position to appreciate James better if one compared him with the dramatists of the seventeenth century\u2014Racine and Moli\u00e8re, whom he resembles in form as well as in point of view, and even Shakespeare, when allowances are made for the most extreme differences in subject and form. These poets are not, like Dickens and Hardy, writers of melodrama\u2014either humorous or pessimistic, nor secretaries of society like Balzac, nor prophets like Tolstoy: they are occupied simply with the presentation of conflicts of moral character, which they do not concern themselves about softening or averting. They do not indict society for these situations: they regard them as universal and inevitable. They do not even blame God for allowing them: they accept them as the conditions of life.\nIt is also possible to see many of James's stories as psychological thought-experiments about selection. In his preface to the New York edition of The American he describes the development of the story in his mind as exactly such: the \"situation\" of an American, \"some robust but insidiously beguiled and\nbetrayed, some cruelly wronged, compatriot...\" with the focus of the story being on the response of this wronged man. The Portrait of a Lady may be an experiment to see what happens when an idealistic young woman suddenly becomes very rich. In many of his tales, characters seem to exemplify alternative futures and possibilities, as most markedly in \"The Jolly Corner\", in which the protagonist and a ghost-doppelganger live alternative American and European lives; and in others, like The Ambassadors, an older James seems fondly to regard his own younger self facing a crucial moment.\nMajor novels\nThe first period of James's fiction, usually considered to have culminated in The Portrait of a Lady, concentrated on the contrast between Europe and America. The style of these novels is generally straightforward and, though personally characteristic, well within the norms of 19th-century fiction. Roderick Hudson (1875) is a K\u00fcnstlerroman that traces the development of the title character, an extremely talented sculptor. Although the book shows some signs of immaturity\u2014this was James's first serious attempt at a full-length novel\u2014it has attracted favourable comment due to the vivid realisation of the three major characters: Roderick Hudson, superbly gifted but unstable and unreliable; Rowland Mallet, Roderick's limited but much more mature friend and patron; and Christina Light, one of James's most enchanting and maddening femmes fatales. The pair of Hudson and Mallet has been seen as representing the two sides of James's own nature: the wildly imaginative artist and the brooding conscientious mentor.In The Portrait of a Lady (1881) James concluded the first phase of his career with a novel that remains his most popular piece of long fiction. The story is of a spirited young American woman, Isabel Archer, who \"affronts her destiny\" and finds it overwhelming. She inherits a large amount of money and subsequently becomes the victim of Machiavellian scheming by two American expatriates. The narrative is set mainly in Europe, especially in England and Italy. Generally regarded as the masterpiece of his early phase, The Portrait of a Lady is described as a psychological novel, exploring the minds of his characters, and almost a work of social science, exploring the differences between Europeans and Americans, the old and the new worlds.The second period of James's career, which extends from the publication of The Portrait of a Lady through the end of the nineteenth century, features less popular novels including The Princess Casamassima, published serially in The Atlantic Monthly in 1885\u20131886, and The Bostonians, published serially in The Century Magazine during the same period. This period also featured James's celebrated Gothic novella, The Turn of the Screw (1898).\nThe third period of James's career reached its most significant achievement in three novels published just around the start of the 20th century: The Wings of the Dove (1902), The Ambassadors (1903), and The Golden Bowl (1904). Critic F. O. Matthiessen called this \"trilogy\" James's major phase, and these novels have certainly received intense critical study. It was the second-written of the books, The Wings of the Dove (1902) that was the first published because it attracted no serialization. This novel tells the story of Milly Theale, an American heiress stricken with a serious disease, and her impact on the people around her. Some of these people befriend Milly with honourable motives, while others are more self-interested. James stated in his autobiographical books that Milly was based on Minny Temple, his beloved cousin who died at an early age of tuberculosis. He said that he attempted in the novel to wrap her memory in the \"beauty and dignity of art\".\nShorter narratives\nJames was particularly interested in what he called the \"beautiful and blest nouvelle\", or the longer form of short narrative. Still, he produced a number of very short stories in which he achieved notable compression of sometimes complex subjects. The following narratives are representative of James's achievement in the shorter forms of fiction.\n\"A Tragedy of Error\" (1864), short story\n\"The Story of a Year\" (1865), short story\nA Passionate Pilgrim (1871), novella\nMadame de Mauves (1874), novella\nDaisy Miller (1878), novella\nThe Aspern Papers (1888), novella\nThe Lesson of the Master (1888), novella\nThe Pupil (1891), short story\n\"The Figure in the Carpet\" (1896), short story\nThe Beast in the Jungle (1903), novella\nAn International Episode (1878)\nPicture and Text\nFour Meetings (1885)\nA London Life, and Other Tales (1889)\nThe Spoils of Poynton (1896)\nEmbarrassments (1896)\nThe Two Magics: The Turn of the Screw, Covering End (1898)\nA Little Tour of France (1900)\nThe Sacred Fount (1901)\nViews and Reviews (1908)\nThe Wings of the Dove, Volume I (1902)\nThe Wings of the Dove, Volume II (1909)\nThe Finer Grain  (1910)\nThe Outcry (1911)\nLady Barbarina: The Siege of London, An International Episode and Other Tales (1922)\nThe Birthplace (1922)Plays\nAt several points in his career James wrote plays, beginning with one-act plays written for periodicals in 1869 and 1871 and a dramatisation of his popular novella Daisy Miller in 1882. From 1890 to 1892, having received a bequest that freed him from magazine publication, he made a strenuous effort to succeed on the London stage, writing a half-dozen plays of which only one, a dramatisation of his novel The American, was produced. This play was performed for several years by a touring repertory company and had a respectable run in London, but did not earn very much money for James. His other plays written at this time were not produced.In 1893, however, he responded to a request from actor-manager George Alexander for a serious play for the opening of his renovated St. James's Theatre, and wrote a long drama, Guy Domville, which Alexander produced. There was a noisy uproar on the opening night, 5 January 1895, with hissing from the gallery when James took his bow after the final curtain, and the author was upset. The play received moderately good reviews and had a modest run of four weeks before being taken off to make way for Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, which Alexander thought would have better prospects for the coming season.After the stresses and disappointment of these efforts James insisted that he would write no more for the theatre, but within weeks had agreed to write a curtain-raiser for Ellen Terry. This became the one-act \"Summersoft\", which he later rewrote into a short story, \"Covering End\", and then expanded into a full-length play, The High Bid, which had a brief run in London in 1907, when James made another concerted effort to write for the stage. He wrote three new plays, two of which were in production when the death of Edward\u00a0VII on 6 May 1910 plunged London into mourning and theatres closed. Discouraged by failing health and the stresses of theatrical work, James did not renew his efforts in the theatre, but recycled his plays as successful novels. The Outcry was a best-seller in the United States when it was published in 1911. During the years 1890\u20131893 when he was most engaged with the theatre, James wrote a good deal of theatrical criticism and assisted Elizabeth Robins and others in translating and producing Henrik Ibsen for the first time in London.Leon Edel argued in his psychoanalytic biography that James was traumatised by the opening night uproar that greeted Guy Domville, and that it plunged him into a prolonged depression. The successful later novels, in Edel's view, were the result of a kind of self-analysis, expressed in fiction, which partly freed him from his fears. Other biographers and scholars have not accepted this account, however; the more common view being that of F.O. Matthiessen, who wrote: \"Instead of being crushed by the collapse of his hopes [for the theatre]... he felt a resurgence of new energy.\"\nNon-fiction\nBeyond his fiction, James was one of the more important literary critics in the history of the novel. In his classic essay The Art of Fiction (1884), he argued against rigid prescriptions on the novelist's choice of subject and method of treatment. He maintained that the widest possible freedom in content and approach would help ensure narrative fiction's continued vitality. James wrote many valuable critical articles on other novelists; typical is his book-length study of Nathaniel Hawthorne, which has been the subject of critical debate. Richard Brodhead has suggested that the study was emblematic of James's struggle with Hawthorne's influence, and constituted an effort to place the elder writer \"at a disadvantage.\" Gordon Fraser, meanwhile, has suggested that the study was part of a more commercial effort by James to introduce himself to British readers as Hawthorne's natural successor.When James assembled the New York Edition of his fiction in his final years, he wrote a series of prefaces that subjected his own work to searching, occasionally harsh criticism.\nAt 22 James wrote The Noble School of Fiction for The Nation's first issue in 1865. He would write, in all, over 200 essays and book, art, and theatre reviews for the magazine.For most of his life James harboured ambitions for success as a playwright. He converted his novel The American into a play that enjoyed modest returns in the early 1890s. In all he wrote about a dozen plays, most of which went unproduced. His costume drama Guy Domville failed disastrously on its opening night in 1895. James then largely abandoned his efforts to conquer the stage and returned to his fiction. In his Notebooks he maintained that his theatrical experiment benefited his novels and tales by helping him dramatise his characters' thoughts and emotions. James produced a small but valuable amount of theatrical criticism, including perceptive appreciations of Henrik Ibsen.With his wide-ranging artistic interests, James occasionally wrote on the visual arts. Perhaps his most valuable contribution was his favourable assessment of fellow expatriate John Singer Sargent, a painter whose critical status has improved markedly in recent decades. James also wrote sometimes charming, sometimes brooding articles about various places he visited and lived in. His most famous books of travel writing include Italian Hours (an example of the charming approach) and The American Scene (on the brooding side).James was one of the great letter-writers of any era. More than ten thousand of his personal letters are extant, and over three thousand have been published in a large number of collections. A complete edition of James's letters began publication in 2006, edited by Pierre Walker and Greg Zacharias. As of 2014, eight volumes have been published, covering the period from 1855 to 1880. James's correspondents included celebrated contemporaries like Robert Louis Stevenson, Edith Wharton and Joseph Conrad, along with many others in his wide circle of friends and acquaintances. The letters range from the \"mere twaddle of graciousness\" to serious discussions of artistic, social and personal issues.\nVery late in life James began a series of autobiographical works: A Small Boy and Others, Notes of a Son and Brother, and the unfinished The Middle Years. These books portray the development of a classic observer who was passionately interested in artistic creation but was somewhat reticent about participating fully in the life around him.\nReception\nCriticism, biographies and fictional treatments\nJames's work has remained steadily popular with the limited audience of educated readers to whom he spoke during his lifetime, and has remained firmly in the canon, but, after his death, some American critics, such as Van Wyck Brooks, expressed hostility towards James for his long expatriation and eventual naturalisation as a British subject. Other critics such as E.\u00a0M. Forster complained about what they saw as James's squeamishness in the treatment of sex and other possibly controversial material, or dismissed his late style as difficult and obscure, relying heavily on extremely long sentences and excessively latinate language. 'Even in his lifetime,' explains scholar Hazel Hutchinson, 'James had a reputation as a difficult writer for clever readers.' Oscar Wilde criticised him for writing \"fiction as if it were a painful duty\". Vernon Parrington, composing a canon of American literature, condemned James for having cut himself off from America. Jorge Luis Borges wrote about him, \"Despite the scruples and delicate complexities of James, his work suffers from a major defect: the absence of life.\"  And Virginia Woolf, writing to Lytton Strachey, asked, \"Please tell me what you find in Henry James.\u00a0... we have his works here, and I read, and I can't find anything but faintly tinged rose water, urbane and sleek, but vulgar and pale as Walter Lamb. Is there really any sense in it?\" The novelist W. Somerset Maugham wrote, \"He did not know the English as an Englishman instinctively knows them and so his English characters never to my mind quite ring true,\" and argued, \"The great novelists, even in seclusion, have lived life passionately. Henry James was content to observe it from a window.\" Maugham nevertheless wrote, \"The fact remains that those last novels of his, notwithstanding their unreality, make all other novels, except the very best, unreadable.\" Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn observed that James \"never really wrote about the English very well. His English characters don't work for me.\"Despite these criticisms, James is now valued for his psychological and moral realism, his masterful creation of character, his low-key but playful humour, and his assured command of the language. In his 1983 book, The Novels of Henry James, Edward Wagenknecht offers an assessment that echoes Theodora Bosanquet's:\n\n\"To be completely great,\" Henry James wrote in an early review, \"a work of art must lift up the heart,\" and his own novels do this to an outstanding degree\u00a0... More than sixty years after his death, the great novelist who sometimes professed to have no opinions stands foursquare in the great Christian humanistic and democratic tradition. The men and women who, at the height of World War\u00a0II, raided the secondhand shops for his out-of-print books knew what they were about. For no writer ever raised a braver banner to which all who love freedom might adhere.\nWilliam Dean Howells saw James as a representative of a new realist school of literary art which broke with the English romantic tradition epitomised by the works of Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray. Howells wrote that realism found \"its chief exemplar in Mr. James... A novelist he is not, after the old fashion, or after any fashion but his own.\" F.R. Leavis championed Henry James as a novelist of \"established pre-eminence\" in The Great Tradition (1948), asserting that The Portrait of a Lady and The Bostonians were \"the two most brilliant novels in the language.\" James is now prized as a master of point of view who moved literary fiction forward by insisting in showing, not telling, his stories to the reader.\n\nPortrayals in fiction\nHenry James has been the subject of a number of novels and stories, including the following:\nBoon by H.G.

He was a member of the Symbolist La Jeune Belgique group, but his best known works are realist. His first work was Salon de Bruxelles (1863), a collection of art criticism. His best known novel is Un M\u00e2le (1881).\n\nBiography\nLemonnier was born in Ixelles, Brussels.He studied law, and then took a clerkship in a government office, which he resigned after three years. Lemonnier inherited Flemish blood from both parents, and with it the animal force and pictorial energy of the Flemish temperament. He published a Salon de Bruxelles in 1863, and again in 1866. His early friendships were chiefly with artists; and he wrote art criticisms with recognized discernment. In 1868 he was a founding member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Libre des Beaux-Arts, an avant-gardist group whose ideals he championed. Taking a house in the hills near Namur, he devoted himself to sport, and developed the intimate sympathy with nature which informs his best work. Nos Flamands (1869) and Croquis d'automne (1870) date from this time. Paris-Berlin (1870), a pamphlet pleading the cause of France, and full of the author's horror of war, had a great success.His capacity as a novelist, in the fresh, humorous description of peasant life, was revealed in Un Coin de village (1879). In Un M\u00e2le (1881) he achieved a different kind of success. It deals with the amours of a poacher and a farmer's daughter, with the forest as a background. Cachapr\u00e8s, the poacher, seems the very embodiment of the wild life around him. The rejection of Un M\u00e2le by the judges for the quinquennial prize of literature in 1883 made Lemonnier the centre of a school, inaugurated at a banquet given in his honour on 27 May 1883. Le Mort (1882), which describes the remorse of two peasants for a murder they have committed, provides a vivid representation of terror. It was remodelled as a tragedy in five acts (1899) by its author. Ceux de la gl\u00e8be (1889), dedicated to the \"children of the soil\", was written in 1885.He turned aside from local subjects for some time to produce a series of psychological novels, books of art criticism, etc., of considerable value, but assimilating more closely to French contemporary literature. The most striking of his later novels include Happe-chair (1886), often compared with Zola's Germinal, L'Arche, journal d'une maman (1894) and Le Vent dans les moulins (1901), which returns to Flemish subjects.In 1888 Lemonnier was prosecuted in Paris for offending against public morals by a story in Gil Blas, and was condemned to a fine. In a later prosecution at Brussels he was defended by Edmond Picard, and acquitted; and he was arraigned for a third time, at Bruges, for his L'Homme en amour, but again acquitted. He represented his own case in Les Deux consciences (1902). L'Ile vierge (1897) was the first of a trilogy to be called La L\u00e9gende de la vie, which was to trace, under the fortunes of the hero, the pilgrimage of man through sorrow and sacrifice to the conception of the divinity within him. In Adam et Eve (1899) and Au C\u0153ur frais de la for\u00eat (1900), he preached the return to nature as the salvation not only of the individual but of the community. Among his other more important works are G. Courbet, et ses \u0153uvres (1878); L'Histoire des Beaux-Arts en Belgique 1830\u20131887 (1887); En Allemagne (1888), dealing especially with the Pinakothek at Munich; La Belgique (1888), an elaborate descriptive work with many illustrations; La Vie belge (1905); and Alfred Stevens et son \u0153uvre (1906).Lemonnier spent much time in Paris, and was one of the early contributors to the Mercure de France. He began to write at a time when Belgian letters lacked style; and with much toil, and some initial extravagances, he created a medium for the expression of his ideas. He explained something of the process in a preface contributed to Gustave Abel's Labeur de la prose (1902). His prose is magnificent and sonorous, but abounds in neologisms and strange metaphors. Rue Camille Lemonnier\/Camille Lemonnierstraat in western Ixelles, is named in his honor.\nWorks\nReferences\nSources\n\u00a0This article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

Ironic and skeptical, he was considered in his day the ideal French man of letters. He was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, and won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a nobility of style, a profound human sympathy, grace, and a true Gallic temperament\".France is also widely believed to be the model for narrator Marcel's literary idol Bergotte in Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time.\nEarly years\nThe son of a bookseller, France, a bibliophile, spent most of his life around books. His father's bookstore specialized in books and papers on the French Revolution and was frequented by many writers and scholars. France studied at the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas, a private Catholic school, and after graduation he helped his father by working in his bookstore. After several years, he secured the position of cataloguer at Bacheline-Deflorenne and at Lemerre. In 1876 he was appointed librarian for the French Senate.\n\nLiterary career\nFrance began his literary career as a poet and a journalist. In 1869, Le Parnasse Contemporain published one of his poems, \"La Part de Madeleine\". In 1875, he sat on the committee in charge of the third Parnasse Contemporain compilation. As a journalist, from 1867, he wrote many articles and notices. He became known with the novel Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard (1881). Its protagonist, skeptical old scholar Sylvester Bonnard, embodied France's own personality. The novel was praised for its elegant prose and won him a prize from the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. \nIn La Rotisserie de la Reine Pedauque (1893) France ridiculed belief in the occult; and in Les Opinions de J\u00e9r\u00f4me Coignard (1893), France captured the atmosphere of the fin de si\u00e8cle. He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1896.\nFrance took a part in the Dreyfus affair. He signed \u00c9mile Zola's manifesto supporting Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish army officer who had been falsely convicted of espionage. France wrote about the affair in his 1901 novel Monsieur Bergeret.\nFrance's later works include L'\u00cele des Pingouins (Penguin Island, 1908) which satirizes human nature by depicting the transformation of penguins into humans \u2013 after the birds have been baptized by mistake by the almost-blind Abbot Mael. It is a satirical history of France, starting in Medieval times, going on to the author's own time with special attention to the Dreyfus affair and concluding with a dystopian future. Les dieux ont soif (The Gods Are Athirst, 1912) is a novel, set in Paris during the French Revolution, about a true-believing follower of Maximilien Robespierre and his contribution to the bloody events of the Reign of Terror of 1793\u201394. It is a wake-up call against political and ideological fanaticism and explores various other philosophical approaches to the events of the time. La Revolte des Anges (Revolt of the Angels, 1914) is often considered Anatole France's most profound and ironic novel. Loosely based on the Christian understanding of the War in Heaven, it tells the story of Arcade, the guardian angel of Maurice d'Esparvieu. Bored because Bishop d'Esparvieu is sinless, Arcade begins reading the bishop's books on theology and becomes an atheist. He moves to Paris, meets a woman, falls in love, and loses his virginity causing his wings to fall off, joins the revolutionary movement of fallen angels, and meets the Devil, who realizes that if he overthrew God, he would become just like God. Arcade realizes that replacing God with another is meaningless unless \"in ourselves and in ourselves alone we attack and destroy Ialdabaoth.\" \"Ialdabaoth\", according to France, is God's secret name and means \"the child who wanders\".\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921. He died in 1924 and is buried in the Neuilly-sur-Seine community cemetery near Paris.\nOn 31 May 1922, France's entire works were put on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Prohibited Books Index) of the Catholic Church. He regarded this as a \"distinction\". This Index was abolished in 1966.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1877, France married Val\u00e9rie Gu\u00e9rin de Sauville, a granddaughter of Jean-Urbain Gu\u00e9rin, a miniaturist who painted Louis XVI. Their daughter Suzanne was born in 1881 (and died in 1918).\nFrance's relations with women were always turbulent, and in 1888 he began a relationship with Madame Arman de Caillavet, who conducted a celebrated literary salon of the Third Republic. The affair lasted until shortly before her death in 1910.After his divorce, in 1893, France had many liaisons, notably with a Madame Gagey, who committed suicide in 1911.In 1920, France married for the second time, to Emma Lapr\u00e9votte.France was a socialist and an outspoken supporter of the 1917 Russian Revolution. In 1920, he gave his support to the newly founded French Communist Party.France had a brain size just two-thirds normal.\nReputation\nThe English writer George Orwell defended France and declared that his work remained very readable, and that \"it is unquestionable that he was attacked partly from political motives\".\nWorks\nPoetry\n\"Les L\u00e9gions de Varus\", poem published in 1867 in the Gazette rim\u00e9e.\nPo\u00e8mes dor\u00e9s (1873)\nLes Noces corinthiennes (The Bride of Corinth) (1876)Prose fiction\nJocaste et le chat maigre (Jocasta and the Famished Cat) (1879)\nLe Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard (The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard) (1881)\nLes D\u00e9sirs de Jean Servien (The Aspirations of Jean Servien) (1882)\nAbeille (Honey-Bee) (1883)\nBalthasar (1889)\nTha\u00efs (1890)\nL'\u00c9tui de nacre (Mother of Pearl) (1892)\nLa R\u00f4tisserie de la reine P\u00e9dauque (At the Sign of the Reine P\u00e9dauque) (1892)\nLes Opinions de J\u00e9r\u00f4me Coignard (The Opinions of Jerome Coignard) (1893)\nLe Lys rouge (The Red Lily) (1894)\nLe Puits de Sainte Claire (The Well of Saint Clare) (1895)\nL'Histoire contemporaine (A Chronicle of Our Own Times)\n1: L'Orme du mail (The Elm-Tree on the Mall)(1897)\n2: Le Mannequin d'osier (The Wicker-Work Woman) (1897)\n3: L'Anneau d'am\u00e9thyste (The Amethyst Ring) (1899)\n4: Monsieur Bergeret \u00e0 Paris (Monsieur Bergeret in Paris) (1901)\nClio (1900)\nHistoire comique (A Mummer's Tale) (1903)\nSur la pierre blanche (The White Stone) (1905)\nL'Affaire Crainquebille (1901)\nL'\u00cele des Pingouins (Penguin Island) (1908)\nLes Contes de Jacques Tournebroche (The Merrie Tales of Jacques Tournebroche) (1908)\nLes Sept Femmes de Barbe bleue et autres contes merveilleux (The Seven Wives of Bluebeard and Other Marvelous Tales) (1909)\nLes dieux ont soif  (The Gods Are Athirst) (1912)\nLa R\u00e9volte des anges (The Revolt of the Angels) (1914)Memoirs\nLe Livre de mon ami (My Friend's Book) (1885)\nPierre Nozi\u00e8re (1899)\nLe Petit Pierre (Little Pierre) (1918)\nLa Vie en fleur (The Bloom of Life) (1922)Plays\nAu petit bonheur (1898)\nCrainquebille (1903)\nLa Com\u00e9die de celui qui \u00e9pousa une femme muette (The Man Who Married A Dumb Wife) (1908)\nLe Mannequin d'osier (The Wicker Woman) (1928)Historical biography\nVie de Jeanne d'Arc (The Life of Joan of Arc) (1908)Literary criticism\nAlfred de Vigny (1869)\nLe Ch\u00e2teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte (1888)\nLe G\u00e9nie Latin (The Latin Genius) (1909)Social criticism\nLe Jardin d'\u00c9picure (The Garden of Epicurus) (1895)\nOpinions sociales (1902)\nLe Parti noir (1904)\nVers les temps meilleurs (1906)\nSur la voie glorieuse (1915)\nTrente ans de vie sociale, in four volumes, (1949, 1953, 1964, 1973)References\nExternal links\nWorks by Anatole France at Project Gutenberg\nList of Works\nWorks by or about Anatole France at Internet Archive\nWorks by Anatole France at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \nWorks by Anatole France at Open Library \nAnatole France on Nobelprize.org \n\"Anatole France, Nobel Prize Winner\" by Herbert S.

He is most famous for the novel \u00c0 rebours (1884, published in English as Against the Grain or Against Nature). He supported himself by way of a 30-year career in the French civil service.\nHuysmans' work is considered remarkable for its idiosyncratic use of the French language, large vocabulary, descriptions, satirical wit and far-ranging erudition. First considered part of Naturalism, he became associated with the decadent movement with his publication of \u00c0 rebours. His work expressed his deep pessimism, which had led him to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. In later years, his novels reflected his study of Catholicism, religious conversion, and becoming an oblate. He discussed the iconography of Christian architecture at length in La cath\u00e9drale (1898), set at Chartres and with its cathedral as the focus of the book.\nL\u00e0-bas (1891), En route (1895) and La cath\u00e9drale (1898) are a trilogy that feature Durtal, an autobiographical character whose spiritual progress is tracked and who converts to Catholicism. In the novel that follows, L'Oblat (1903), Durtal becomes an oblate in a monastery, as Huysmans himself was in the Benedictine Abbey at Ligug\u00e9, near Poitiers, in 1901. La cath\u00e9drale was his most commercially successful work. Its profits enabled Huysmans to retire from his civil service job and live on his royalties.\n\nParents and early life\nHuysmans was born in Paris in 1848.  His father Godfried Huysmans was Dutch, and a lithographer by trade.  His mother Malvina Badin Huysmans had been a schoolmistress.  Huysmans' father died when he was eight years old.  After his mother quickly remarried, Huysmans resented his stepfather, Jules Og, a Protestant who was part-owner of a Parisian book-bindery.\nDuring childhood, Huysmans turned away from the Roman Catholic Church.  He was unhappy at school but completed his coursework and earned a baccalaur\u00e9at.\n\nCivil service career\nFor 32 years, Huysmans worked as a civil servant for the French Ministry of the Interior, a job he found tedious. The young Huysmans was called up to fight in the Franco-Prussian War, but was invalided out with dysentery. He used this experience in an early story, \"Sac au dos\" (Backpack) (later included in his collection, Les Soir\u00e9es de M\u00e9dan).\nAfter his retirement from the Ministry in 1898, made possible by the commercial success of his novel, La cath\u00e9drale, Huysmans planned to leave Paris and move to Ligug\u00e9. He intended to set up a community of Catholic artists, including Charles-Marie Dulac (1862-1898). He had praised the young painter in La cath\u00e9drale. Dulac died a few months before Huysmans completed his arrangements for the move to Ligug\u00e9, and he decided to stay in Paris.\nIn addition to his novels, Huysmans was known for his art criticism in L'Art moderne (1883) and Certains (1889). He was a founding member of the Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt. An early advocate of Impressionism, he admired such artists as Gustave Moreau and Odilon Redon.\nIn 1905 Huysmans was diagnosed with cancer of the mouth. He died in 1907 and was interred in the cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse, Paris.\n\nPersonal life\nHuysmans never married or had children. He had a long-term, on-and-off relationship with Anna Meunier, a seamstress.\nWriting career\nHe used the name Joris-Karl Huysmans when he published his writing, as a way of honoring his father's ancestry. His first major publication was a collection of prose poems, Le drageoir aux \u00e9pices (1874), which were strongly influenced by Baudelaire. They attracted little attention but revealed flashes of the author's distinctive style.\nHuysmans followed it with the novel, Marthe, Histoire d'une fille (1876). The story of a young prostitute, it was closer to Naturalism and brought him to the attention of \u00c9mile Zola. His next works were similar: sombre, realistic and filled with detailed evocations of Paris, a city Huysmans knew intimately. Les Soeurs Vatard (1879), dedicated to Zola, deals with the lives of women in a bookbindery. En m\u00e9nage (1881) is an account of a writer's failed marriage. The climax of his early work is the novella \u00c0 vau-l'eau (1882) (Downstream or With the Flow), the story of a downtrodden clerk, Monsieur Folantin, and his quest for a decent meal.\n\nHuysmans' novel \u00c0 rebours (Against the Grain or Against Nature or Wrong Way; 1884) became his most famous, or notorious. It featured the character of an aesthete, des Esseintes, and decisively broke from Naturalism. It was seen as an example of \"decadent\" literature. The description of des Esseintes' \"alluring liaison\" with a \"cherry-lipped youth\" was believed to have influenced other writers of the decadent movement, including Oscar Wilde.It is now considered an important step in the formation of \"gay literature\". \u00c0 rebours gained notoriety as an exhibit in the trials of Oscar Wilde in 1895. The prosecutor referred to it as a \"sodomitical\" book. The book appalled Zola, who felt it had dealt a \"terrible blow\" to Naturalism.Huysmans began to drift away from the Naturalists and found new friends among the Symbolist and Catholic writers whose work he had praised in \u00c0 rebours. They included Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly, Villiers de L'Isle Adam and L\u00e9on Bloy. St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 was so pleased with the publicity his verse had received from the novel that he dedicated one of his most famous poems, \"Prose pour des Esseintes\", to its hero. Barbey d'Aurevilly told Huysmans that after writing \u00c0 rebours, he would have to choose between \"the muzzle of a pistol and the foot of the Cross.\"  Huysmans, who had received a secular education and abandoned his Catholic religion in childhood, returned to the Catholic Church eight years later.Huysmans' next novel, En rade, an unromantic account of a summer spent in the country, did not sell as well as its predecessor.\nHis L\u00e0-bas (1891) attracted considerable attention for its portrayal of Satanism in France in the late 1880s. He introduced the character Durtal, a thinly disguised self-portrait. The later Durtal novels, En route (1895), La cath\u00e9drale (1898) and L'oblat (1903), explore Durtal\/Huysmans' conversion to Roman Catholicism. En route depicts Durtal's spiritual struggle during his stay at a Trappist monastery.  In La cath\u00e9drale (1898), the protagonist is at Chartres, intensely studying the cathedral and its symbolism. The commercial success of this book enabled Huysmans to retire from the civil service and live on his royalties.  In L'Oblat, Durtal becomes a Benedictine oblate. He finally learns to accept the world's suffering.\nHuysmans' work was known for his idiosyncratic use of the French language, extensive vocabulary, detailed and sensuous descriptions, and biting, satirical wit. It also displays an encyclopaedic erudition, ranging from the catalogue of decadent Latin authors in \u00c0 rebours to the discussion of the iconography of Christian architecture in La cath\u00e9drale. Huysmans expresses a disgust with modern life and a deep pessimism. This had led him first to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Later he returned to the Catholic Church, as noted in his Durtal novels.\n\nHonors\nHuysmans was made a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1892, for his work with the civil service. In 1905, his admirers persuaded the French government to promote him to Officier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur for his literary achievements.\n\nStyle and Influence\n\"It takes me two years to 'document' myself for a novel\u00a0\u2013 two years of hard work. That is the trouble with the naturalistic novel\u00a0\u2013 it requires so much documentary care. I never make, like Zola, a plan for a book. I know how it will begin and how it will end\u00a0\u2013 that's all. When I finally get to writing it, it goes along rather fast\u00a0\u2013 assez vite.\"\"Barbaric in its profusion, violent in its emphasis, wearying in its splendor, it is\u00a0\u2013 especially in regard to things seen\u00a0\u2013 extraordinarily expressive, with all the shades of a painter's palette. Elaborately and deliberately perverse, it is in its very perversity that Huysmans' work - so fascinating, so repellent, so instinctively artificial - comes to represent, as the work of no other writer can be said to do, the main tendencies, the chief results, of the Decadent movement in literature.\" (Arthur Symons, The Decadent Movement in Literature)\n\"...Continually dragging Mother Image by the hair or the feet down the worm-eaten staircase of terrified Syntax.\" (L\u00e9on Bloy, quoted in Robert Baldick, The Life of J.-K. Huysmans). Critical reviews by L\u00e9on Bloy of \u00c0 rebours, En rade, and L\u00e0-bas published contemporaneously, in various journals or reviews, as Huysmans' novels came out over the years, in 1884, 1887, 1891, can be found, collected together and published 6 years after Huysmans' death, in book form, in On Huysmans' Tomb. \"It is difficult to find a writer whose vocabulary is so extensive, so constantly surprising, so sharp and yet so exquisitely gamey in flavour, so constantly lucky in its chance finds and in its very inventiveness.\" (Julien Gracq)\n\"In short, he kicks the oedipal to the curb\" (M. Quaine, Heirs and Graces, 1932, Jowett \/ Arcana)\nHuysmans' novel, Against the Grain, has more discussions of sound, smell and taste than any other work of literature we know of. For example, one chapter consists entirely of smell hallucinations so vivid that they exhaust the book's central character, Des Esseintes, a bizarre, depraved aristocrat. A student of the perfumer's art, Esseintes has developed several devices for titillating his jaded senses. Besides special instruments for re-creating any conceivable odour, he has constructed a special \"mouth organ\", designed to stimulate his palate rather than his ears. The organ's regular pipes have been replaced by rows of little barrels, each containing a different liqueur. In Esseintes's mind, the taste of each liqueur corresponded with the sound of a particular instrument.\n\"Dry cura\u00e7ao, for instance, was like the clarinet with its shrill, velvety note: k\u00fcmmel like the oboe, whose timbre is sonorous and nasal; cr\u00e8me de menthe and anisette like the flute, at one and the same time sweet and poignant, whining and soft. Then to complete the orchestra, comes kirsch, blowing a wild trumpet blast; gin and whisky, deafening the palate with their harsh outbursts of cornets and trombones:liqueur brandy, blaring with the overwhelming crash of the tubas.\"By careful and persistent experimentation, Esseintes learned to \"execute on his tongue a succession of voiceless melodies; noiseless funeral marches, solemn and stately; could hear in his mouth solos of cr\u00e8me de menthe, duets of vespertro and rum.\" The protagonist of Submission (2015), a controversial novel by Michel Houellebecq, is a literary scholar specializing in Huysmans and his work; Huysmans's relation to Catholicism serves as a foil for the book's treatment of Islam in France.\n\nWorks by Huysmans\nLe drageoir aux \u00e9pices (1874)\nMarthe (1876)\nLes Soeurs Vatard (1879)\nSac au dos (1880)\nCroquis Parisiens (1880, 2nd ed. 1886)\nEn m\u00e9nage (1881)\nPierrot sceptique (1881, written in collaboration with L\u00e9on Hennique)\n\u00c0 vau-l'eau (1882)\nL'art moderne (1883)\n\u00c0 rebours (1884)\nEn rade (1887)\nUn Dilemme (1887)\nCertains (1889)\nLa bi\u00e8vre (1890)\nL\u00e0-bas (1891)\nEn route (1895)\nLa cath\u00e9drale (1898)\nLa Bi\u00e8vre et Saint-S\u00e9verin (1898)\nLa magie en Poitou.

His work has been translated into thirty languages. \n\nBiography\nAesthetic and political struggles\nThe grandson of Norman notaries and the son of a doctor, Mirbeau spent his childhood in a village in Normandy, R\u00e9malard, pursuing secondary studies at a Jesuit college in Vannes, which expelled him at the age of fifteen. Two years after the traumatic experience of the 1870 war, he was tempted by a call from the Bonapartist leader Dugu\u00e9 de la Fauconnerie, who hired him as private secretary and introduced him to L'Ordre de Paris.\nAfter his debut in journalism in the service of the Bonapartists, and his debut in literature when he worked as a ghostwriter, Mirbeau began to publish under his own name. Thereafter, he wrote in order to express his own ethical principles and aesthetic values. A supporter of the anarchist cause (cf. La Gr\u00e8ve des \u00e9lecteurs) and fervent supporter of Alfred Dreyfus, Mirbeau embodied the intellectual who involved himself in civic issues. Independent of all parties, Mirbeau believed that one's primary duty was to remain lucid.As an art critic, he campaigned on behalf of the \u201cgreat gods nearest to his heart\u201d: he sang the praises of Auguste Rodin, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Paul Gauguin, F\u00e9licien Rops  Auguste Renoir, F\u00e9lix Vallotton, and Pierre Bonnard, and was an early advocate of Vincent van Gogh, Camille Claudel, Aristide Maillol, and Maurice Utrillo (cf. his Combats esth\u00e9tiques, 1993).\nAs a literary critic and early member of Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt, he 'discovered' Maurice Maeterlinck and Marguerite Audoux and admired Remy de Gourmont, Marcel Schwob, L\u00e9on Bloy, Georges Rodenbach, Alfred Jarry, Charles-Louis Philippe, \u00c9mile Guillaumin, Valery Larbaud and L\u00e9on Werth (cf. his Combats litt\u00e9raires, 2006).\n\nMirbeau's novels\nAutobiographical novels\nMirbeau ghostwrote ten novels, including three for the Swiss writer Dora Melegari. He made his own literary debut with Le Calvaire (Calvary, 1886), in which writing allowed him to overcome the traumatic effects of his devastating liaison with the ill-reputed Judith Vinmer (1858-1951), renamed Juliette Roux in the novel.In 1888, Mirbeau published L'Abb\u00e9 Jules (Abb\u00e9 Jules), the first pre-Freudian novel written under the influence of Dostoyevsky to appear in French literature; the text featured two main characters: l'abb\u00e9 Jules and Father Pamphile. In S\u00e9bastien Roch (1890) (English translation: S\u00e9bastien Roch, 2000), Mirbeau purged the traumatic effects of his experience as a student at a Jesuits school in Vannes. In the novel, the 13-year-old S\u00e9bastien is sexually abused by a priest at the school and the abuse destroys his life.\nCrisis of the novel\nMirbeau then underwent a grave existential and literary crisis, yet during this time, he still published in serial form a pre-existentialist novel about the artist's fate, Dans le ciel (In the Sky), introducing the figure of a painter (Lucien), directly modeled on Van Gogh. In the aftermath of the Dreyfus Affair \u2014 which exacerbated Mirbeau's pessimism \u2014 he published two novels judged to be scandalous by self-styled paragons of virtue: Le Jardin des supplices (Torture Garden (1899) and Le Journal d'une femme de chambre (Diary of a Chambermaid) (1900), then Les Vingt et un Jours d'un neurasth\u00e9nique (The twenty one days of a neurasthenic person) (1901). In the process of writing these works, Mirbeau unsettled traditional novelistic conventions, exercising  collage techniques, transgressing codes of verisimilitude and fictional credibility, and defying the hypocritical rules of propriety.\n\nDeath of the novel\nIn his last two novels, La 628-E8 (1907) \u2013 including La Mort de Balzac \u2013 and Dingo (1913), he strayed ever further from realism, giving free rein to clinical fantasy elements and casting his cat and his own dog as heroes. These last Mirbeau stories show a complete break with the conventions of realist fiction, also signifying a breakdown of reality.\nMirbeau's theatre\nIn the theatre, Mirbeau made his first steps with a proletarian drama and modern tragedy, Les Mauvais bergers (The Bad Shepherds, 1897). Then he experienced worldwide acclaim with Les affaires sont les affaires (Business is business, 1903) \u2014 his classical comedy of manners and characters in the tradition of Moli\u00e8re. Here Mirbeau featured the character of Isidore Lechat, predecessor of the modern master of business intrigue, a product of the new world, a figure who makes money from everything and spreads his tentacles out over the world.\nIn 1908 \u2014 at the end of a long legal and media battle\n\u2014 Mirbeau saw his play Le Foyer (Home) performed by the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise. In this work, he broached a new taboo subject, the economic and sexual exploitation of adolescents in a home that pretended to be a charitable one.\n\nHe also wrote six one act plays, published under the title of Farces et moralit\u00e9s (1904), among them being L'\u00c9pid\u00e9mie (Epidemics, 1898). Here, Mirbeau can be seen as anticipating the theatre of Bertolt Brecht, Marcel Aym\u00e9, Harold Pinter, and Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco. He calls language itself into question, demystifying law, ridiculing the discourse of politicians, and making fun of the language of love (Les Amants, The Lovers, 1901).\n\nPosthumous fame\nMirbeau has never been forgotten, and there has been no interruption in the publication of his works.

He is best remembered for his books about Japanese culture, especially his collections of legends and ghost stories, such as Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things. In the United States, he is also known for his writings about New Orleans, based on his decade-long stay there.\nHearn was born on the Greek island of Lefkada to a Greek mother and an Irish father, after which a complex series of conflicts and events led to him being moved to Dublin, where he was abandoned first by his mother, then his father, and finally by his father's aunt (who had been appointed his official guardian). At the age of 19, he was put on a boat to the United States, where he found work as a newspaper reporter, first in Cincinnati and later in New Orleans. From there, he was sent as a correspondent to the French West Indies, where he stayed for two years, and then to Japan, where he would remain for the rest of his life.\nIn Japan, Hearn married a Japanese woman with whom he had four children. His writings about Japan offered the Western world a glimpse into a largely unknown but fascinating culture at the time.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nPatrick Lafcadio Hearn was born on the Greek Ionian Island of Lefkada on 27 June 1850, the son of Rosa Antoniou Kassimatis, a Greek woman of noble Kytheran descent, and Charles Bush Hearn, an Irishman from County Offaly who was a surgeon in the British Army. His father was stationed in Lefkada during the British protectorate of the United States of the Ionian Islands. Lafcadio was baptized Patrikios Lefcadios Hearn (\u03a0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd) in the Greek Orthodox Church, but he seems to have been called \"Patrick Lefcadio Kassimati Charles Hearn\" in English, and the middle name \"Lafcadio\" was given to him in honour of the island where he was born. Hearn's parents were married in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on 25 November 1849, several months after his mother had given birth to Hearn's older brother, George Robert Hearn, on 24 July 1849. George died on 17 August 1850, two months after Lafcadio's birth.\nEmigration to Ireland and abandonment\nHearn's father Charles was promoted to Staff Surgeon Second Class and in 1850 was reassigned from Lefkada to the British West Indies. Since his family did not approve of the marriage, and because he was worried that his relationship might harm his career prospects, Charles did not inform his superiors of his son or pregnant wife and left his family behind. In 1852, he arranged to send his son and wife to live with his family in Dublin, where they received a cool reception. Hearn's Protestant mother, Elizabeth Holmes Hearn, had difficulty accepting Rosa's Greek Orthodox views and lack of education (she was illiterate and spoke no English). Rosa found it difficult to adapt to a foreign culture and the Protestantism of her husband's family, and was eventually taken under the wing of Elizabeth's sister, Sarah Holmes Brenane, a widow who had converted to Catholicism.\nDespite Sarah's efforts, Rosa suffered from homesickness. When her husband returned to Ireland on medical leave in 1853, it became clear that the couple had become estranged. Charles Hearn was assigned to the Crimean Peninsula, again leaving his pregnant wife and child in Ireland. When he came back in 1856, severely wounded and traumatized, Rosa had returned to her home island of Cerigo in Greece, where she gave birth to their third son, Daniel James Hearn. Lafcadio had been left in the care of Sarah Brenane.\nCharles petitioned to have the marriage with Rosa annulled, on the basis of her lack of signature on the marriage contract, which made it invalid under English law. After being informed of the annulment, Rosa almost immediately married Giovanni Cavallini, a Greek citizen of Italian ancestry who was later appointed by the British as governor of Cerigotto. Cavallini required as a condition of the marriage that Rosa give up custody of both Lafcadio and James. As a result, James was sent to his father in Dublin and Lafcadio remained in the care of Sarah, who had disinherited Charles because of the annulment. Neither Lafcadio nor James saw their mother again, who had four children with her second husband. Rosa was eventually committed to the National Mental Asylum on Corfu, where she died in 1882.Charles Hearn, who had left Lafcadio in the care of Sarah Brenane for the past four years, now appointed her as Lafcadio's permanent guardian. He married his childhood sweetheart, Alicia Goslin, in July 1857, and left with his new wife for a posting in Secunderabad, where they had three daughters prior to Alicia's death in 1861. Lafcadio never saw his father again: Charles Hearn died of malaria in the Gulf of Suez in 1866.In 1857, at age seven and despite the fact that both his parents were still alive, Hearn became the permanent ward of his great aunt, Sarah Brenane. She divided her residency between Dublin in the winter months, her husband's estate at Tramore, County Waterford on the southern Irish coast, and a house at Bangor, North Wales. Brenane also engaged a tutor during the school year to provide basic instruction and the rudiments of Catholic dogma. Hearn began exploring Brenane's library and read extensively in Greek literature, especially myths.\nCatholic education and more abandonment\nIn 1861, Hearn's aunt, aware that Hearn was turning away from Catholicism, and at the urging of Henry Hearn Molyneux, a relative of her late husband and a distant cousin of Hearn, enrolled him at the Institution Eccl\u00e9siastique, a Catholic church school in Yvetot, France. Hearn's experiences at the school confirmed his lifelong conviction that Catholic education consisted of \"conventional dreariness and ugliness and dirty austerities and long faces and Jesuitry and infamous distortion of children's brains.\" Hearn became fluent in French and would later translate into English the works of Guy de Maupassant and Gustave Flaubert.\nIn 1863, again at the suggestion of Molyneux, Hearn was enrolled at St. Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, a Catholic seminary at what is now the University of Durham. In this environment, Hearn adopted the nickname \"Paddy\" to try to fit in better, and was the top student in English composition for three years. At age 16, while at Ushaw, Hearn injured his left eye in a schoolyard mishap. The eye became infected and, despite consultations with specialists in Dublin and London, and a year spent out of school convalescing, went blind. Hearn also suffered from severe myopia, so his injury left him permanently with poor vision, requiring him to carry a magnifying glass for close work and a pocket telescope to see anything beyond a short distance (Hearn avoided eyeglasses, believing they would gradually weaken his vision further). The iris was permanently discolored, and left Hearn self-conscious about his appearance for the rest of his life, causing him to cover his left eye while conversing and always posing for the camera in profile so that the left eye was not visible.In 1867, Henry Molyneux, who had become Sarah Brenane's financial manager, went bankrupt, along with Brenane. There was no money for tuition, and Hearn was sent to London's East End to live with Brenane's former maid. She and her husband had little time or money for Hearn, who wandered the streets, spent time in workhouses, and generally lived an aimless, rootless existence. His main intellectual activities consisted of visits to libraries and the British Museum.\nEmigration to Cincinnati\nBy 1869, Henry Molyneux had recovered some financial stability and Brenane, now 75, was infirm. Resolving to end his expenditures on the 19-year-old Hearn, he purchased a one-way ticket to New York and instructed Hearn to find his way to Cincinnati, to locate Molyneux's sister and her husband, Thomas Cullinan, and to obtain their assistance in making a living. Upon meeting Hearn in Cincinnati, the family had little assistance to offer: Cullinan gave him $5 and wished him luck in seeking his fortune. As Hearn would later write, \"I was dropped moneyless on the pavement of an American city to begin life.\"For a time, he was impoverished, living in stables or store rooms in exchange for menial labor. He eventually befriended the English printer and communalist Henry Watkin, who employed him in his printing business, helped find him various odd jobs, lent him books from his library, including utopianists Fourier, Dixon and Noyes, and gave Hearn a nickname which stuck with him for the rest of his life, The Raven, from the Poe poem. Hearn also frequented the Cincinnati Public Library, which at that time had an estimated 50,000 volumes. In the spring of 1871 a letter from Henry Molyneux informed him of Sarah Brenane's death and Molyneux's appointment as sole executor. Despite Brenane having named him as the beneficiary of an annuity when she became his guardian, Hearn received nothing from the estate and never heard from Molyneux again.\nNewspaper and literary work\nBy the strength of his talent as a writer, Hearn obtained a job as a reporter for the Cincinnati Daily Enquirer, working for the newspaper from 1872 to 1875. Writing with creative freedom in one of Cincinnati's largest circulating newspapers, he became known for his lurid accounts of local murders, developing a reputation as the paper's premier sensational journalist, as well as the author of sensitive accounts of some of the disadvantaged people of Cincinnati. The Library of America selected one of these murder accounts, Gibbeted, for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime, published in 2008. After one of his murder stories, the Tanyard Murder, had run for several months in 1874, Hearn established his reputation as Cincinnati's most audacious journalist, and the Enquirer raised his salary from $10 to $25 per week.In 1874, Hearn and the young Henry Farny, later a renowned painter of the American West, wrote, illustrated, and published an 8-page weekly journal of art, literature and satire entitled Ye Giglampz. The Cincinnati Public Library reprinted a facsimile of all nine issues in 1983. The work was considered by a twentieth century critic to be \"Perhaps the most fascinating sustained project he undertook as an editor.\"\nMarriage and firing by the Enquirer\nOn 14 June 1874, Hearn, aged 23, married Alethea (\"Mattie\") Foley, a 20-year-old African American woman, and former slave, an action in violation of Ohio's anti-miscegenation law at that time. In August 1875, in response to complaints from a local clergyman about his anti-religious views and pressure from local politicians embarrassed by some of his satirical writing in Ye Giglampz, the Enquirer fired him, citing as its reason his illegal marriage. He went to work for the rival newspaper The Cincinnati Commercial. The Enquirer offered to re-hire him after his stories began appearing in the Commercial and its circulation began increasing, but Hearn, incensed at the paper's behavior, refused. Hearn and Foley separated, but attempted reconciliation several times before divorcing in 1877. Foley remarried in 1880. While working for the Commercial he championed the case of Henrietta Wood, a former slave who won a major reparations case.While working for the Commercial Hearn agreed to be carried to the top of Cincinnati's tallest building on the back of a famous steeplejack, Joseph Roderiguez Weston, and wrote a half-terrified, half-comic account of the experience. It was also during this time that Hearn wrote a series of accounts of the Bucktown and Levee neighborhoods of Cincinnati, \"...one of the few depictions we have of black life in a border city during the post-Civil War period.\" He also wrote about local black song lyrics from the era, including a song titled \"Shiloh\" that was dedicated to a Bucktown resident named \"Limber Jim.\" In addition, Hearn had printed in the Commercial a stanza he had overheard when listening to the songs of the roustabouts, working on the city's levee waterfront. Similar stanzas were recorded in song by Julius Daniels in 1926 and Tommy McClennan in his version of \"Bottle Up and Go\" (1939).\nMove to New Orleans\nDuring the autumn of 1877, recently divorced from Mattie Foley and restless, Hearn had begun neglecting his newspaper work in favor of translating into English works of the French author Gautier. He had also grown increasingly disenchanted with Cincinnati, writing to Henry Watkin, \"It is time for a fellow to get out of Cincinnati when they begin to call it the Paris of America.\" With the support of Watkin and Cincinnati Commercial publisher Murat Halstead, Hearn left Cincinnati for New Orleans, where he initially wrote dispatches on the \"Gateway to the Tropics\" for the Commercial.\nHearn lived in New Orleans for nearly a decade, writing first for the newspaper Daily City Item beginning in June 1878, and later for the Times Democrat. Since the Item was a 4-page publication, Hearn's editorial work changed the character of the newspaper dramatically. He began at the Item as a news editor, expanding to include book reviews of Bret Harte and \u00c9mile Zola, summaries of pieces in national magazines such as Harper's, and editorial pieces introducing Buddhism and Sanskrit writings. As editor, Hearn created and published nearly two hundred woodcuts of daily life and people in New Orleans, making the Item the first Southern newspaper to introduce cartoons and giving the paper an immediate boost in circulation. Hearn gave up carving the woodcuts after six months when he found the strain was too great for his eye.\nAt the end of 1881, Hearn took an editorial position with the New Orleans Times Democrat and was employed translating items from French and Spanish newspapers as well as writing editorials and cultural reviews on topics of his choice. He also continued his work translating French authors into English: G\u00e9rard de Nerval, Anatole France, and most notably Pierre Loti, an author who influenced Hearn's own writing style.  Milton Bronner, who edited Hearn's letters to Henry Watkin, wrote: \"[T]he Hearn of New Orleans was the father of the Hearn of the West Indies and of Japan,\" and this view was endorsed by Norman Foerster. During his tenure at the Times Democrat, Hearn also developed a friendship with editor Page Baker, who went on to champion Hearn's literary career; their correspondence is archived at the Loyola University New Orleans Special Collections & Archives.The vast number of his writings about New Orleans and its environs, many of which have not been collected, include the city's Creole population and distinctive cuisine, the French Opera, and Louisiana Voodoo. Hearn wrote enthusiastically of New Orleans, but also wrote of the city's decay, \"a dead bride crowned with orange flowers\".Hearn's writings for national publications, such as Harper's Weekly and Scribner's Magazine, helped create the popular reputation of New Orleans as a place with a distinct culture more akin to that of Europe and the Caribbean than to the rest of North America. Hearn's best-known Louisiana works include: \n\nGombo zh\u00e8bes: Little dictionary of Creole proverbs (1885)\nLa Cuisine Cr\u00e9ole (1885), a collection of culinary recipes from leading chefs and noted Creole housewives who helped make New Orleans famous for its cuisine\nChita: A Memory of Last Island (1889), a novella based on the hurricane of 1856 first published in Harper's Monthly in 1888Hearn also published in Harper's Weekly the first known written article (1883) about Filipinos in the United States, the Manilamen or Tagalogs, one of whose villages he had visited at Saint Malo, southeast of Lake Borgne in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana.\nAt the time he lived there, Hearn was little known, and even now he is little known for his writing about New Orleans, except by local cultural devotees. However, more books have been written about him than any former resident of New Orleans except Louis Armstrong.Hearn's writings for the New Orleans newspapers included impressionistic descriptions of places and characters and many editorials denouncing political corruption, street crime, violence, intolerance, and the failures of public health and hygiene officials. Despite the fact that he is credited with \"inventing\" New Orleans as an exotic and mysterious place, his obituaries of the vodou leaders Marie Laveau and Doctor John Montenet are matter-of-fact and debunking. Selections of Hearn's New Orleans writings have been collected and published in several works, starting with Creole Sketches in 1924, and more recently in Inventing New Orleans: Writings of Lafcadio Hearn.\nMove to the French West Indies\nHarper's sent Hearn to the West Indies as a correspondent in 1887. He spent two years in Martinique and in addition to his writings for the magazine, produced two books: Two Years in the French West Indies and Youma, The Story of a West-Indian Slave, both published in 1890.\nLater life in Japan\nIn 1890, Hearn went to Japan with a commission as a newspaper correspondent, which was quickly terminated.  It was in Japan, however, that he found a home and his greatest inspiration. Through the good will of Basil Hall Chamberlain, Hearn gained a teaching position during the summer of 1890 at the Shimane Prefectural Common Middle School and Normal School in Matsue, a town in western Japan on the coast of the Sea of Japan. During his fifteen-month stay in Matsue, Hearn married Koizumi Setsuko, the daughter of a local samurai family, with whom he had four children: Kazuo, Iwao, Kiyoshi, and Suzuko. He became a Japanese citizen, assuming the legal name Koizumi Yakumo in 1896 after accepting a teaching position in Tokyo; Koizumi is his wife's surname and Yakumo is from yakumotatsu, a poetic modifier word (makurakotoba) for Izumo Province, which means \"where many clouds grow\". After having been Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and, later on, Spencerian, he became Buddhist.During late 1891, Hearn obtained another teaching position in Kumamoto, at the Fifth High Middle School (a predecessor of Kumamoto University), where he spent the next three years and completed his book Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan (1894). In October 1894, he secured a journalism job with the English-language newspaper Kobe Chronicle, and in 1896, with some assistance from Chamberlain, he began teaching English literature at Tokyo Imperial University, a job he had until 1903. In 1904, he was a lecturer at Waseda University.\nWhile in Japan, he encountered the art of ju-jutsu which made a deep impression upon him: \"Hearn, who encountered judo in Japan at the end of the nineteenth century, contemplated its concepts with the awed tones of an explorer staring about him in an extraordinary and undiscovered land. \"What Western brain could have elaborated this strange teaching, never to oppose force by force, but only direct and utilize the power of attack; to overthrow the enemy solely through his own strength, to vanquish him solely by his own efforts? Surely none! The Western mind appears to work in straight lines; the Oriental, in wonderful curves and circles.\" When he was teaching at the Fifth High Middle School, the headmaster was Kano Jigoro himself.\nOn 26 September 1904, Hearn died of heart failure in Tokyo at the age of 54. His grave is at the Z\u014dshigaya Cemetery in Tokyo's Toshima district.\nLegacy\nLiterary tradition\nIn the late 19th century, Japan was still largely unknown and exotic to Westerners. However, with the introduction of Japanese aesthetics, particularly at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, Japanese styles became fashionable in Western countries. Consequently, Hearn became known to the world by his writings concerning Japan. In later years, some critics would accuse Hearn of exoticizing Japan, but because he offered the West some of its first descriptions of pre-industrial and Meiji Era Japan, his work is generally regarded as having historical value.Admirers of Hearn's work have included Ben Hecht, John Erskine, Malcolm Cowley and Jorge Luis Borges.Hearn was a major translator of the short stories of Guy de Maupassant.Yone Noguchi is quoted as saying about Hearn, \"His Greek temperament and French culture became frost-bitten as a flower in the North.\"\nMuseums\nThe Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum and his old residence in Matsue are still two of the city's most popular tourist attractions. In addition, another small museum dedicated to Hearn opened in Yaizu, Shizuoka in 2007 (ja:\u713c\u6d25\u5c0f\u6cc9\u516b\u96f2\u8a18\u5ff5\u9928).\nThe first museum in Europe for Lafcadio Hearn was inaugurated in Lefkada, Greece, his birthplace, on 4 July 2014, as Lefcadio Hearn Historical Center. It contains early editions, rare books and Japanese collectibles. The visitors, through photos, texts and exhibits, can wander in the significant events of Lafcadio Hearn's life, but also in the civilizations of Europe, America and Japan of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries through his lectures, writings and tales. The municipalities of Kumamoto, Matsue, Shinjuku, Yaizu, Toyama University, the Koizumi family and other people from Japan and Greece contributed to the establishment of Lefcadio Hearn Historical Center.There is also a cultural center named after Hearn at the University of Durham, and a Japanese Gardens named for him in Tramore, County Waterford, Ireland.\n\nSister cities\nHis life journey later connected its both ends; Lefkada and Shinjuku became sister cities in 1989. Another pair of cities he lived, New Orleans and Matsue did the same in 1994.\nMedia and theater\nThe Japanese director Masaki Kobayashi adapted four Hearn tales into his 1964 film, Kwaidan. Some of his stories have been adapted by Ping Chong into his puppet theatre, including the 1999 Kwaidan and the 2002 OBON: Tales of Moonlight and Rain.\nIn 1984, four episode Japanese TV series Nihon no omokage (ja:\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u9762\u5f71, Remnants of Japan), depicting Hearn's departure from the United States and later life in Japan, was broadcast with Greek-American actor George Chakiris as Hearn. The story was later adapted to theatrical productions.\nHe is also depicted as the main inspiration for Yukari Yakumo and Maribel Hearn in Touhou Project games and audio CDs\nWorks\nLouisiana subjects\nLa Cuisine Creole: A Collection of Culinary Recipes (1885)\nGombo Zh\u00e8bes\": A Little Dictionary of Creole Proverbs, Selected from Six Creole Dialects.

She is known for introducing naturalism into Spanish literature, for her detailed descriptions of reality, and for her ground-breaking  introduction of feminist ideas into the literature of her era. Her ideas about women's rights for education also made her a prominent feminist figure.\n\nLife\nChildhood and education\nEmilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n was born into an affluent noble family in A Coru\u00f1a,  Galicia, Spain. The family's principal residence was in R\u00faa Tabernas but they also owned two other houses, one close to Sanxenxo and the other, known as the Pazo de Meir\u00e1s, located in the outskirts of the city.\nHer father, believing in the intellectual equality of men and women, provided her with the best education possible, inspiring her life-long love for literature. She wrote her first poems at the age of nine.\nEmilia had access to a broad range of reading material in her father's library, later stating that among her favorites were Don Quijote de la Mancha, the Bible and the Iliad. Other early readings included La conquista de M\u00e9xico by Antonio de Sol\u00eds and Parallel Lives by Plutarch. She was fascinated by books about the French revolution. Her family would spend their winters in Madrid, where Emilia attended a French school sponsored by the Royal Family, and where she was introduced to the work of La Fontaine and Jean Racine. Her frequent visits to France would prove to be especially useful later in her life by helping her connect with the literary world of Europe and become familiar with important authors like Victor Hugo. When she was twelve her family decided to stop their winter visits to Madrid, staying in A Coru\u00f1a where she studied with private tutors. She refused to follow the rules that limited women to just learning about music and home economics.  She received formal education on all types of subjects, with an emphasis on the humanities and languages. She became fluent in French, English, and German. She was not permitted to attend college. Women were forbidden to study science and philosophy, but she became familiar with those subjects by reading and talking with friends of her father.\nMarriage and literary career\nAt the age of sixteen Emilia married Don Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Quiroga y P\u00e9rez de Deza, a country gentleman who was himself only eighteen and still a law student. The following year, 1868, saw the outbreak of the Glorious Revolution, resulting in the deposition of Queen Isabella II and awakening in Emilia an interest in politics. She is believed to have taken an active part in the underground campaign against Amadeo I of Spain and, later, against the republic.\nIn 1876 she won a literary prize offered by the municipality of Oviedo, for an essay entitled Estudio cr\u00edtico de las obras del padre Feijoo (Critical Essay on the Works of Father Feijoo), the  subject of her essay being a Benedictine monk. Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n always had a great admiration for Feijoo, an eighteenth-century Galician intellectual, possibly due to his feminism avant la lettre. She also published her first book of poems in the same year, entitled Jaime in honor of her newborn son. This was followed by a series of articles in La Ciencia cristiana, a highly orthodox Roman Catholic magazine, edited by Juan Orti y Lara.Her first novel, Pascual L\u00f3pez: autobiograf\u00eda de un estudiante de medicina (Pascual L\u00f3pez: Autobiography of a Medical Student), which appeared in 1879, was written in a realist, romantic style. She was encouraged by its success and, two years later, she published Un viaje de novios (A Honeymoon Trip), in which an incipient interest in French naturalism can be observed, causing something of a sensation at the time. This was further fuelled by the appearance of La tribuna (1883), which was more heavily influenced by the ideas of \u00c9mile Zola and is widely considered to be the first Spanish naturalist novel. Her response to the critics' outrage was published in 1884 under the title La cuesti\u00f3n palpitante (The Critical Issue). Her husband did not feel strong enough to weather the ensuing social scandal created by a woman daring to express her views about such matters and two years later the couple began an amicable separation, Emilia living with their children while her husband took up residence in the Castle of Santa Cruz in A Coru\u00f1a, which he had acquired at an auction. It was only after their separation that her relationship with the writer Gald\u00f3s blossomed into a full-blown intimate affair, which was to prove enduring.\n1885 saw the publication of El Cisne de Vilamorta (The Swan of Vilamorta), in \nwhich the naturalist scenes are more numerous and more pronounced than in any of her previous works, although the author has been accused of shrinking from the logical application of her theories by inserting a romantic and inappropriate ending. Probably the best of Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n's work is embodied in Los pazos de Ulloa (The House of Ulloa), published in 1886, which recounts the slide into decadence of an aristocratic family, as notable for the heroes Nucha and Juli\u00e1n as for characters including the political bravos, Barbacana and Trampeta. Yet perhaps its most abiding merit lies in its depiction of country life, the poetic realization of Galician scenery portrayed in an elaborate, colourful style. A sequel, with the significant title La madre naturaleza (Mother Nature), published in 1887, marked a further advance in the path of naturalism, and henceforth Pardo Baz\u00e1n was universally recognized as one of the principal exponents of the new naturalistic movement in Spain, a role confirmed by the publication of Insolaci\u00f3n (Sunstroke), and Morri\u00f1a (Homesickness) in 1889. In this year her reputation as a novelist reached its highest point.During her last years of writing, Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n wrote many essays and gave lectures in renowned institutions. She also began to intervene in political journalism as well as fighting for the right of women to social and intellectual emancipation. Thus, around 1890, her work evolved towards greater symbolism and spiritualism.\nIn 1905 she published a play entitled Verdad (Truth), better known for its boldness than for its dramatic qualities. Her last novel, Dulce due\u00f1o (Sweet Master) was published in 1911, but she continued to write short stories like El rev\u00f3lver (The Revolver), publishing more than 600 over the course of her career.\nSupport for women's rights\nPardo Baz\u00e1n was a standard bearer for women's rights and dedicated both her literary production and her life to their defense. In all of her works she incorporated her ideas on the modernization of Spanish society, on the need for female education and on women's access to all the rights and opportunities that men already enjoyed.\nIn 1882, she participated in a conference organized by The Free Educational Institution, and openly criticized the education received by the Spanish women, in which values like passivity, obedience and submission to their husbands were relentlessly promoted.\nIn spite of the patent sexism in the intellectual circles of her era, Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n became the first woman to preside over the literature section of the Ateneo de Madrid in 1906, and the first to occupy a chair of Neo-Latin literature at the Central University Of Madrid (former name of The Complutense University of Madrid). She inherited the title of Countess on her father's death in 1908 and in 1910 was appointed a member of the Council of Public Instruction. In 1921 she was appointed to the Senate but never formally took up her seat. Much to her frustration, she was repeatedly refused a seat at the Spanish Royal Academy, purely on the grounds of her gender. \nShe died in Madrid in 1921.\n\nRacial determinism\nAccording to Brian J. Dendle, her naturalism partially drinks from late 19th-century theories of racial heritage and atavism. She was well-versed in the racial theories applied to criminology by Cesare Lombroso. Featuring a Catholic ideological matrix close to Pidal y Mon, she espoused nonetheless racist views. She held antisemitic ideas, to the point of denigrating both Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews. She tried to justify antisemitism in 1899 in the context of the Dreyfus affair in the pages of La Ilustraci\u00f3n Art\u00edstica: \"The Dreyfus affair is nothing but an episode of the secular struggle that covered the Middle Ages in blood in the streets of Valencia and Toledo [...] The crusade against Dreyfus can be explained, and as it can be explained it can be partially justified\".\nFood writer\nFond of gastronomy, in 1905 Pardo Baz\u00e1n prologued La cocina pr\u00e1ctica (\"the practical cuisine\") by her friend Manuel Purga y Parga, aka Picadillo. She later wrote her own culinary works, such as La cocina espa\u00f1ola antigua (1913). She is credited as one of the food writers and gastronomes who joined the initiative for pushing forward the idea of the modern Spanish national cuisine in the early 20th-century, recognisable by Spaniards as their own.\nTribute\nA statue dedicated to Pardo Baz\u00e1n was unveiled in Madrid on 24 June 1926.On September 16, 2017, Google celebrated her 166th birthday with a Google Doodle.\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\u00c1lvarez Chillida, Gonzalo (2002).

His inflammatory articles, known as paliques (\u201cchitchat\u201d), as well as his advocacy of liberalism and anti-clericalism, made him a formidable and controversial critical voice. He died in Oviedo.\n\nBiography\nAlas was born in Zamora, from Asturian parents who moved to that city. He spent his childhood living in Le\u00f3n and Guadalajara, until he moved to Oviedo (Asturias) in 1863. There he studied for the  Bachillerato (Secondary Education) and began his law studies. He lived in Madrid from 1871 to 1878, where he began his career as a journalist (adopting the pen-name \"Clar\u00edn\" in 1875) and he graduated with the thesis El Derecho y la Moralidad (Law and Morality) in 1878. He taught in Zaragoza from 1882 to 1883. In 1883 he returned to Oviedo to take up a position as professor of Roman law.\nAbove all, Clar\u00edn is the author of La Regenta, his masterpiece and one of the best novels of the 19th century. It is a long work, similar to Flaubert's Madame Bovary, one of its influences. Other influences included Naturalism and Krausism, a philosophical current which promoted the cultural and ethical regeneration of Spain.\nLa Regenta is special for its great wealth of characters and secondary stories, while the main character's description is left slightly unfocused and vague. On the other hand, the downfall of the provincial lady has a place amidst two very diverse suitors: the most handsome man in the city and the cathedral's priest. The depiction of this priest is a key part of the book.\nFor the description of the provincial atmosphere and the city's collective life, Clar\u00edn used techniques such as the internal monologue or the free indirect style, which makes the story be narrated by the characters themselves and allows the reader to witness and experience their intimacy.\nIn 1890, he published a new novel, Su \u00fanico hijo. Even though most critics consider it as a lesser novel in comparison with La Regenta, it is equal to the former in the skill with which the technical resources are used.  Su \u00fanico hijo was originally meant to be the introduction to a trilogy, but aside from an outline and a few fragments of the two sequels, Su \u00fanico hijo was Clar\u00edn's last full-length novel.\nApart from these works, Clar\u00edn is also the author of magnificent stories and of a large number of journalistic articles.  He also wrote an essay, \"La Literatura en 1881\" (1882), in collaboration with Armando Palacio Vald\u00e9s.\nLeopoldo Alas remains a rather enigmatic figure in the Spanish literary world, leaving a legacy that encouraged the search for God and humanism simultaneously. This aberrant confluence has facilitated the presence of various interpretations regarding the author's writings, most noticeably of his masterpiece, La Regenta.\n\nWorks\nReferences\nExternal links\nWorks by Leopoldo Alas at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by or about Leopoldo Alas at Internet Archive\nWorks by Leopoldo Alas at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \nA good website on the author, containing his works in digital version (In Spanish)\nText of Do\u00f1a Berta in original Spanish\n\n","34":"Paul Charles Joseph Bourget (French:\u00a0[bu\u0281\u0292\u025b]; 2 September 1852\u00a0\u2013 25 December 1935) was a French novelist and critic. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times.\nLife\nPaul Bourget was born in Amiens in the Somme d\u00e9partement of Picardy, France. His father, a professor of mathematics, was later appointed to a post in the college at Clermont-Ferrand, where Bourget received his early education. He afterwards studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand and at the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes.\nBetween 1872 and 1873, he produced a volume of verse, Au Bord de la Mer, which was followed by others, the last, Les Aveux, appearing in 1882. Meanwhile, he was making a name in literary journalism and in 1883 he published Essais de Psychologie Contemporaine, studies of eminent writers first printed in the Nouvelle Revue, and now brought together. In 1884 Bourget paid a long visit to Britain, where he wrote his first published story (L'Irr\u00e9parable). Cruelle Enigme followed in 1885; then Andr\u00e9 Cornelis (1886) and Mensonges (1887) - inspired by Octave Mirbeau's life - were received with much favour.Bourget, who had abandoned Catholicism in 1867, began a gradual return to it in 1889, fully converting only in 1901. In 1893, in an interview he gave in America, he spoke about his changed views: \"For many years I, like most young men in modern cities, was content to drift along in agnosticism, but I was brought to my senses at last by the growing realization that...the life of a man who simply said 'I don't know, and not knowing I do the thing that pleases me,' was not only empty in itself and full of disappointment and suffering, but was a positive influence for evil upon the lives of others.\" On the other hand, \"those men and women who follow the teachings of the church are in a great measure protected from the moral disasters which...almost invariably follow when men and women allow themselves to be guided and swayed by their senses, passions and weaknesses.\" These were the themes of his novel Le Disciple (1889), which he wrote, as he says in his American interview, just after abandoning his \"drifting and comfortable belief in agnosticism\". It is the story of philosopher Adrien Sixte, whose advocacy of materialism and positivism wields a terrible influence over an admiring but unstable student, Robert Geslon, whose actions, in turn, lead to the tragic death of a young woman. Le Disciple caused a stir in France and became a bestseller. Exemplifying the novelist's graver side, it was one of Gladstone's favourite books. John Cowper Powys listed Le Disciple at number 33 in his One Hundred Best Books.\n\u00c9tudes et portraits, first published in 1888, contains impressions of Bourget's stay in England and Ireland\u2014especially reminiscences of the months which he spent at Oxford and in 1891 Sensations d'Italie, notes of a tour in that country, revealed a fresh phase of his powers; and Outre-Mer (1895), a book in two volumes, is his critical journal of a visit to the United States in 1893. Also in 1891 appeared the novel Coeur de Femme, and Nouveaux Pastels, \"types\" of the characters of men, the sequel to a similar gallery of female types (Pastels, 1890). His later novels include La Terre Promise (1892); Cosmopolis (1892), a psychological novel, with Rome as a background; Une Idylle tragique (1896); La Duchesse bleue (1897); Le Fant\u00f4me (1901); Les Deux S\u0153urs (1905); and some volumes of shorter stories\u2014Complications Sentimentales (1896), the powerful Drames de famille (1898), and Un Homme d'Affaires (1900). L'Etape (1902) was a study of the inability of a family raised too rapidly from the peasant class to adapt itself to new conditions. This powerful study of contemporary manners was followed by Un Divorce (1904), a defence of the Roman Catholic position that divorce is a violation of natural laws. He was admitted to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1894, and in 1895 was promoted to be an officer of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, having received the decoration of the order ten years before.Several new novels were to follow, including La Vie Passe (1910), Le Sens de la Mort (1915), Lazarine (1917), N\u00e9m\u00e9sis (1918), and Laurence Albani (1920), as well as three volumes of short stories and plays, La Barricade (1910) and Le Tribun (1912). Two other plays, Un Cas de Conscience (1910) and La Crise (1912) were written by him in collaboration with others. A volume of critical studies appeared in 1912, and another set of travel sketches, Le D\u00e9mon du Midi, in 1914.\nOn 16 March 1914, he was present in the offices of the newspaper, Le Figaro when the newspaper's editor, his friend Gaston Calmette was shot and killed by Henriette Caillaux the wife of a former Prime Minister of France. Her subsequent trial caused an enormous scandal at the time.He was a contributor to Le Visage de l'Italie, a 1929 book about Italy prefaced by Benito Mussolini.Bourget died on Christmas Day 1935, aged 83, in Paris.\n\nLiterary significance and criticism\nAs a writer of verse Bourget's poems, which were collected in two volumes (1885\u20131887), throw light upon his mature method and the later products of his art. It was in criticism that he excelled. Notable are the Sensations d'Italie (1891), and the various psychological studies.Bourget's reputation as a novelist is assured in some academic and intellectual circles but while they were widely popular in his time, his novels have long been largely forgotten by the general reading public.  Impressed by the art of Henry Beyle (Stendhal), he struck out on a new course at a moment when the realist school was the vogue in French fiction.  With Bourget, observation was mainly directed to the human character. At first his purpose seemed to be purely artistic, but when Le Disciple appeared, in 1889, the preface to that story revealed his moral enthusiasm. After that, he varied between his earlier and his later manner, but his work in general was more seriously conceived. He painted the intricate emotions of women, whether wronged, erring or actually vicious; and he described the ideas, passions and failures of the young men of France.\nOne of his poems was the inspiration for an art song by Claude Debussy titled Beau Soir.\nOther settings by Debussy of poems by Bourget include 'Romance' and 'Les Cloches'.\n\nWorks\nBourget, Paul (1889). \u00c9tudes et portraits. 1.

His brothers, Atanasio and Leopoldo, also were writers.\nHis first writings were printed in the Revista Europea. These were pungent essays, remarkable for independent judgment and refined humour, and found so much favor with the public that the young beginner was soon appointed editor of the Revista. The best of his critical work is collected in Los Oradores del Ateneo (1878), Los Novelistas espa\u00f1oles (1878), Nuevo viaje al Parnaso and La Literatura en 1881 (1882), this last being written in collaboration with Leopoldo Alas.In 1881 he published a novel, El se\u00f1orito Octavio, which shows an uncommon power of observation, and the optimistic promise of better things to come. In Marta y Maria (1883), a portrayal of the struggle between religious vocation and earthly passion, somewhat in the manner of Valera, Palacio Vald\u00e9s achieved a popular triumph.According to a contemporaneous assessment by James Fitzmaurice-Kelly in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition:\n\nEl Idilio de un enfermo (1884), a most interesting fragment of autobiography, has scarcely met with the recognition which it deserves: perhaps because the pathos of the story is too unadorned. The publication of Peredas Sotileza is doubtless responsible for the conception of Jos\u00e9 (1885), in which Palacio Vald\u00e9s gives a realistic picture of the manners and customs of seafaring folk, creates the two convincing characters whom he names Jos\u00e9 and Leonarda, and embellishes the whole with passages of animated description barely inferior to the finest penned by Pereda himself. The emotional imagination of the writer expressed itself anew in the charming story Riverita (1886), one of whose attractive characters develops into the heroine of Maximina (1887); and from Maximina, in its turn, is taken the novice who figures as a professed nun among the personages of La Hermana San Sulpicio (1889), in which the love-passages between Zeferino Sanjurjo and Gloria Berm\u00fadez are set off with elaborate, romantic descriptions of Seville. El Cuarto poder (1888) is, as its name implies, concerned with the details, not always edifying, of journalistic life. Two novels issued in 1892, La Espuma and La Fe, were enthusiastically praised in foreign countries, but in Spain their reception was cold\u00a0... Subsequently Palacio Vald\u00e9s returned to his earlier and better manner in Los Majos de C\u00e1diz (1896) and in La Alegr\u00eda del Capit\u00e1n Ribot (1899). In these novels, and still more in Trist\u00e1n, \u00f3 el pesimismo (1906), he frees himself from the reproach of undue submission to French influences. In any case he takes a prominent place in modern Spanish literature as a keen analyst of emotion and a sympathetic, delicate, humorous observer.\nA collection of his short stories appeared in English translation in 1935.\n\nWorks\nSee also\nIn English\nLiterary realism: General vision of the movement\nSpanish literature: Evolution of Spanish literatureIn Spanish\nwikisource:es:Armando Palacio Vald\u00e9s\nes:Literatura espa\u00f1ola del RealismoReferences\nDiccionario de literatura espa\u00f1ola.

He is known for his four volume novel, Saraswatichandra, acclaimed as one of the masterpiece of Gujarati literature. The novel represents the life of Gujarat during the early part of 19th-century.\nLife\nGovardhanram was born in Vadnagara nagar brahmin family on 20 October 1855 on the day of the Dashera festival at Nadiad, Bombay presidency  (now in Gujarat), to his mother, Shivkashi, and his father, Govardhanram. He took his primary education from the Buddhivardhak Gujarati Shala in Mumbai and Government English School at Nadiad. Thereafter, he joined Elphinstone High School from where he passed his matriculation examination in 1871. In the same year, he joined Elphinstone College to obtain his BA degree. He passed his BA examination at the second attempt, in 1875.After three unsuccessful attempts, he passed LLB examination in 1883, and started working as a lawyer in Mumbai in 1884. At the age of 43, he retired early and settled in his hometown to contribute to Gujarati literature and public service.Govardhanram died in Mumbai on the evening of 4 January 1907.\nPersonal life\nIn 1868, Govardhanram married Harilakshmi, who died in 1874 in a child birth, leaving behind a daughter, Radha, who also died soon after. In 1876, he married Lalitagauri, who gave birth to three daughters, Lilavati (b. 1881), Jashvanti (b. 1884) and Jayanti (b. 1888); and a son, Ramaniyaram (b. 1886). He was a younger cousin of Gujarati writer Mansukhram Tripathi.\nWorks\nIn 1875, he read a paper, A Rude Outline of the General Features of Practical Asceticism in My Sense of the World, before the Friendly Society. According to Gujarati critic Balwantray Thakore, this paper can be considered the key-stone of Govardhanram's ideology, aspiration and character.In 1887, the first volume of Saraswatichandra was published, and was followed by volumes 2, 3 and 4 in 1892, 1898, and 1901, respectively; each volume have a separate subtitle: The Administration of Buddhidhan, The Family-maze of Gunasundari, The Political Administration of Ratnanagari and The Dreamland of Saraswati.

His ancestors included two well-known men of the Greek War of Independence, namely his paternal grandfather and namesake Ioannis Papadiamantopoulos (1766\u20131826), born in Corinth but of ultimately Epirote ancestry (he was executed after the fall of Missolonghi), and his maternal great uncle Iakovos Tombazis (c. 1782\u20131829), from Hydra, who became one of the first admirals of the Greek navy. Moreas's father was Adamantios Papadiamantopoulos from Patras; a judge, scholar, and poet.Moreas received a French education, and went to Paris in 1875 to study law at the University of Paris. While in France, he began associating with literary circles, and became acquainted with Les Hydropathes, a group of French writers that included Alphonse Allais, Charles Cros, Guy de Maupassant, and L\u00e9on Bloy. He was also an acquaintance of the Greek artist Demetrios Galanis and the Romanian poet Ion Minulescu.\nMor\u00e9as died in Paris, France on March 31, 1910.\nWorks\nMor\u00e9as published poetry in his publications Lut\u00e8ce and Le Chat noir, and collected his poems into two editions, Les Syrtes (\"The Sandbanks\") and Cantil\u00e8nes, which were strongly influenced by Paul Verlaine.\nHe was initially a practitioner of the style of Symbolism, and wrote the Symbolist Manifesto (1886), which he published in the newspaper Le Figaro, partly to redeem the reputation of the new generation of young writers from the charge of \"decadence\" that the press had implied. He was considered one of the most important Symbolist poets until the early 1890s.\nIn 1891, as Symbolism became more openly associated with anarchism, he published Le P\u00e8lerin passionn\u00e9 which rejected Northern European and Germanic influences, such as Romanticism (as well as some aspects of Symbolism), in favor of Ancient Roman and Ancient Greek influences. This work helped initiate the \u00c9cole Romane, the aesthetic of which provided Charles Maurras with the ideology necessary for the far-right philosophy Action Fran\u00e7aise.\nMor\u00e9as also wrote Les Demoiselles Goubert, a novel, in association with Paul Adam.

The son of Richard and Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Clemenson) Shorter, young Clement attended school from 1863 to 1871 in Downham Market, Norfolk. He was still quite young when his father died in Melbourne, Australia, where he had gone in an attempt to make a better life for his young family.Once finished with his schooling, Shorter spent four years working for several booksellers and publishers on Paternoster Row in London. In 1877, he found himself working in the Exchequer and Audit Department at Somerset House, as a low-level clerk.Shorter married twice, first to Dora Sigerson, an Irish poet. He married her in 1896, and she died in 1918. In 1920, he remarried, to a woman from Penzance, named Annie Doris Banfield. Shorter, survived by his wife and daughter, died on 19 November 1926, in his home at Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire.\nCareer\nIn journalism\nShorter's career in journalism began in 1888, when he began working as a sub-editor for the Penny Illustrated Paper. At that time, he was also writing for  The Star, a weekly column about books. By 1890, he had resigned his clerical position at Somerset House, to focus solely on his journalistic endeavours.An important influence on the English pictorial press, in 1891 he became editor of the Illustrated London News. By 1893, he had founded and edited Sketch. In 1900, he founded Sphere, which he edited up until his death in 1926. During this time, Shorter maintained writing his controversial weekly column, \"A Literary Letter.\" He described the content of the two papers he edited during this time (first, The Sphere, and shortly thereafter, The Tatler) as \"on more frivolous lines.\"In addition to founding Sketch and The Sphere, he was also the founder of The Tatler.\nAs an author, literary critic, and collector\nIt is difficult to separate Shorter's career as an author and critic from his hobby of collecting manuscripts, books, and other materials related to his favorite authors. He was an avid collector, particularly focusing on the works of the Bront\u00eb sisters. This collecting and research eventually led to some of his most well-known works, including two books about Charlotte Bront\u00eb, and two books about the Bront\u00eb family. Shorter additionally edited Elizabeth Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb in 1899. Shorter's own works of literary criticism include The Bront\u00ebs and their Circle (1896), Immortal Memories (1907), The Bront\u00ebs: Life and Letters (1908), and George Borrow and his Circle (1913).Shorter also wrote multiple books about Napoleon, two about George Borrow, as well as a volume of addresses and essays. His last published work was C. K. S.: an Autobiography, which was edited by J.M. Bulloch, and published posthumously, in 1927.\nReferences\nExternal links\nWorks by Clement King Shorter at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by or about Clement Shorter at Internet Archive\nWorks by Clement Shorter at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \nArchival material at Leeds University Library\n\n","42":"Remy de Gourmont (4 April 1858 \u2013 27 September 1915) was a French Symbolist poet, novelist, and influential critic.  He was widely read in his era, and an important influence on Blaise Cendrars and Georges Bataille. The spelling R\u00e9my de Gourmont is incorrect, albeit common.\n\nLife\nGourmont was born at Bazoches-au-Houlme, Orne, into a publishing family from Cotentin. He was the son of Count Auguste-Marie de Gourmont and his countess, born Mathilde de Montfort. In 1866 he moved to a manor close to Villedieu near La Manche. He studied law at Caen, and was awarded a bachelor's degree in law in 1879; upon his graduation he moved to Paris.\nIn 1881, Gourmont was employed by the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale. He began to write for general circulation periodicals such as Le Monde and Le Contemporain. He took an interest in ancient literature, following the footsteps of Gustave Kahn. During this period, he also met Berthe Courri\u00e8re, model for, and heir of, the sculptor Auguste Cl\u00e9singer, with whom he formed a lifelong attachment, he and Berthe living together for the rest of their lives.\nGourmont also began a literary alliance with Joris-Karl Huysmans, to whom he dedicated his prose work Le Latin mystique (Mystical Latin). In 1889 Gourmont became one of the founders of the Mercure de France, which became a rallying point of the Symbolist movement. Between 1893 and 1894 he was the co-editor, along with Alfred Jarry, of L'Ymagier, a magazine dedicated to symbolist wood carvings. In 1891 he published a polemic called Le Joujou Patriotisme (Patriotism, a toy) in which he argued that France and Germany shared an aesthetic culture and urged a rapprochement between the two countries, contrary to the wishes of nationalists in the French government. This political essay led to his losing his job at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, despite Octave Mirbeau's chronicles.\n\nDuring this same period, Gourmont was stricken with lupus vulgaris.  Disfigured by this illness, he largely retired from public view appearing only at the offices of the Mercure de France. In 1910, Gourmont met Natalie Clifford Barney, to whom he dedicated his Lettres \u00e0 l'Amazone (Letters to the Amazon).\nGourmont's health continued to decline and he began to suffer from locomotor ataxia and be increasingly unable to walk. He was deeply depressed by the outbreak of World War I and died in Paris of cerebral congestion in 1915. Berthe Courri\u00e8re was his sole heir, inheriting a substantial body of unpublished work which she sent to his brother Jean de Gourmont, and dying within the year. Gourmont and Courri\u00e8re are buried Chopins tomb in P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery.\n\nWorks\nHis poetic works include Litanies de la Rose (1892), Les Saintes du Paradis (1898), and Divertissements (1912). His anthology Hieroglyphes (1894), contains his experiments with the possibilities of sound and rhythm. It plunges from perhaps ironic piety to equally ironic blasphemy, reflecting, more than anything else, his interest in medieval Latin literature, and his works led to a fad for late Latin literature among authors like Joris-Karl Huysmans.  He was also a literary critic and essayist of great importance, most notably his Le Probleme du Style. Created in response to Antoine Albalat's The Art of Writing in Twenty Lessons (1899), Le Probleme du Style was a source book for many of the ideas that inspired the literary developments in both England and France and was also admired by T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound in that capacity. In 1922 Aldous Huxley translated Gourmont's novel A Virgin Heart. Pound observed in 1915 that the English Imagist poetic movement derived from the French Symbolistes, Eliot describing Gourmont as the \"critical conscience of his generation\".\nBibliography\nQuotation\n\n\nQue tes mains soient b\u00e9nies, car elles sont impures!\nElles ont des p\u00e9ch\u00e9s cach\u00e9s \u00e0 toutes les jointures;\nLeur peau blanche s'est tremp\u00e9e dans l'odeur \u00e2pre des caresses\nSecr\u00e8tes, parmi l'ombre blanche o\u00f9 rampent les caresses,\nEt l'opale prisonni\u00e8re qui se meurt \u00e0 ton doigt,\nC'est le dernier soupir de J\u00e9sus sur la croix.---Oraisons mauvaisesReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nWorks by Remy de Gourmont at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by or about Remy de Gourmont at Internet Archive\nWorks by Remy de Gourmont at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \nWorks by Remy de Gourmont, at JSTOR\nWorks by Remy de Gourmont, at Hathi Trust\nSelected Poems by Remy de Gourmont (in French)\nLes Amateurs de Remy de Gourmont (In French)\nSelections (in English) from Le Probl\u00e9me du Style\nEzra Pound on Remy de Gourmont\nRichard Aldington on Remy de Gourmont\n\n","43":"Lieutenant-General Mori Rintar\u014d (\u68ee \u6797\u592a\u90ce, February 17, 1862 \u2013 July 8, 1922), known by his pen name Mori \u014cgai (\u68ee \u9d0e\u5916), was a Japanese Army Surgeon general officer, translator, novelist, poet and father of famed author Mari Mori. He obtained his medical license at a very young age and introduced translated German language literary works to the Japanese public. Mori \u014cgai also was considered the first to successfully express the art of western poetry in Japanese. He wrote many works and created many writing styles. The Wild Geese (1911\u20131913) is considered his major work. After his death, he was considered one of the leading writers who modernized Japanese literature.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nMori was born as Mori Rintar\u014d (\u68ee \u6797\u592a\u90ce) in Tsuwano, Iwami Province (present-day Shimane Prefecture). His family were hereditary physicians to the daimy\u014d of the Tsuwano Domain. As the eldest son, it was assumed that he would carry on the family tradition; therefore he was sent to attend classes in the Confucian classics at the domain academy, and took private lessons in rangaku and Dutch.\nIn 1872, after the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the domains, the Mori family relocated to Tokyo. Mori stayed at the residence of Nishi Amane, in order to receive tutoring in German, which was the primary language for medical education at the time. In 1874, he was admitted to the government medical school (the predecessor for Tokyo Imperial University's Medical School), and graduated in 1881 at the age of 19, the youngest person ever to be awarded a medical license in Japan. It was also during this time that he developed an interest in literature, reading extensively from the late-Edo period popular novels, and taking lessons in Chinese poetry and literature.\n\nEarly career\nAfter graduation, Mori enlisted in the Imperial Japanese Army as a medical officer, hoping to specialize in military medicine and hygiene. He was commissioned as a deputy surgeon (lieutenant) in 1882. Mori was sent by the Army to study in Germany (Leipzig, Dresden, Munich, and Berlin) from 1884 to 1888. During this time, he also developed an interest in European literature. As a matter of trivia, Mori \u014cgai is the first Japanese known to have ridden on the Orient Express. One of his major accomplishments was his ability to create works using a style of \"translation\" that he obtained from his experience in European culture.Upon his return to Japan, he was promoted to surgeon first class (captain) in May 1885; after graduating from the Army War College in 1888, he was promoted to senior surgeon, second class (lieutenant colonel) in October 1889. Now a high-ranking army doctor, he pushed for a more scientific approach to medical research, even publishing a medical journal out of his own funds. Meanwhile, he also attempted to revitalize modern Japanese literature and published his own literary journal (Shigarami s\u014dshi, 1889\u20131894) and his own book of poetry (Omokage, 1889). In his writings, he was an \"anti-realist\", asserting that literature should reflect the emotional and spiritual domain. The short story \"The Dancing Girl\" (\u821e\u59eb, Maihime, 1890) described an affair between a Japanese man and a German woman.\nHe married two times. His first wife was Toshiko Akamatsu, a daughter of Admiral Noriyoshi Akamatsu and a close friend of Nishi Amane. The couple married in 1889 and had a son who was born in 1890, Oto, before divorcing later that same year. The divorce was under acrimonious circumstances that irreparably ended his friendship with Nishi. His second wife, whom he married in 1902, was Shigeko Arakawa. They had four children: Mari (1903-1987), Furitsu (1907-1908), who died in childhood, Annu (1909-1998), and Rui (1911-1991). Both daughters, Mari and Annu, as well his son Rui, became writers.\nIn May 1893, Mori was promoted to senior surgeon, first class (colonel).\n\nLater career\nAt the start of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894\u20131895, Mori was sent to Manchuria and, the following year, to Taiwan. In February 1899, he was appointed head of the Army Medical Corps with the rank of surgeon major-general and was based in Kokura, Ky\u016bsh\u016b. His transfer was because of his responses to fellow doctors and his criticism about their fields of research in the Japanese Medical Journal of which he was editor. In 1902, he was reassigned to Tokyo. He was attached to a division in the Russo-Japanese War, based out of Hiroshima.\nIn 1907, Mori was promoted to Surgeon General of the Army (lieutenant general), the highest post within the Japanese Army Medical Corps, and became head of the Imperial Fine Arts Academy, which is now the Japan Art Academy. Also in the same year, he also became chairman of the Beriberi Research Council in the Ministry of the Army and headed their first major research case. Mori \u014cgai discovered the cause of the beriberi disease and managed to create a foundation to build a remedy, but  the problem was only resolved after his death.He was appointed director of the Imperial Museum when he retired in 1916. Mori \u014cgai then died of renal failure and pulmonary tuberculosis six years later, aged 60.\n\nLiterary work\nAlthough Mori did little writing from 1892 to 1902, he continued to edit a literary journal (Mezamashi gusa, 1892\u20131909). He also produced translations of the works of Goethe, Schiller, Ibsen, Hans Christian Andersen, and Hauptmann. It was during the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305) that Mori started keeping a poetic diary. After the war, he began holding tanka writing parties that included several noted poets such as Yosano Akiko. Mori \u014cgai helped found a new magazine called Subaru (literary magazine) in 1909 with the help of others such as Yosano Akiko and Yosano Tekkan. His later works can be divided into three separate periods. From 1909 to 1912, he wrote mostly fiction based on his own experiences. This period includes Vita Sexualis, and his most popular novel, Gan (\u96c1, The Wild Geese, 1911\u201313), which is set in 1881 Tokyo and was filmed by Shir\u014d Toyoda in 1953 as The Mistress.\nIn 1909, he released his novel Vita Sexualis which was abruptly banned a month later. Authorities deemed his work too sexual and dangerous to public morals. Mori \u014cgai, during the period he was writing Vita Sexualis, focused on making a statement regarding the current literary trends of modern Japanese literature. He approached the trend on sexuality and individualism by describing them as a link between body and soul. \u014cgai points out problems concerning the art and literature world in the 19th century in his work. His writing style, depicted from the Meiji government's perspective, derived from naturalism and was implemented with his thoughts that were brought up from writers who focused on the truth.His later works link his concerns with the Ministry of Education regarding the understanding of \"intellectual freedom\" and how they police and dictate the potential of literature. From 1912 to 1916, he wrote mostly historical stories. Deeply affected by the death of General Nogi Maresuke in 1912, he explored the impulses of self-destruction, self-sacrifice and patriotic sentiment. This period includes Sansh\u014d Day\u016b (\u5c71\u6912\u5927\u592b), and Takasebune (\u9ad8\u702c\u821f). From 1916 to 1921, he turned his attention to biographies of three Edo period doctors.\nLegacy\nAs an author, Mori is considered one of the leading writers of the Meiji period. In his literary journals, he instituted modern literary criticism in Japan, based on the aesthetic theories of Karl von Hartmann. A house which Mori lived in is preserved in Kokurakita Ward in Kitaky\u016bsh\u016b, not far from Kokura Station. Here he wrote Kokura Nikki (\"Kokura Diary\"). His birthhouse is also preserved in Tsuwano. The two one-story houses are remarkably similar in size and in their traditional Japanese style.\nHis daughter Mari, who was nineteen years old at the time of his death, wrote extensively about her relationship with her father. Starting with her 1961 novella, A Lovers' Forest (\u604b\u4eba\u305f\u3061\u306e\u68ee, Koibito Tachi no Mori), she wrote tragic stories about love affairs between older men and boys in their late teens which influenced the creation of the Yaoi genre, stories about male-male relationships, written by women for women, that began to appear in the nineteen seventies in Japanese novels and comics. Mori's sister, Kimiko, married Koganei Yoshikiyo. Hoshi Shinichi was one of their grandsons.\n\nCultural references\n\u014cgai Mori, along with many other historical figures from the Meiji Restoration is  a character in the historical fiction novel Saka no Ue no Kumo by Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba.  He also plays a significant part in the historical fantasy novel Teito Monogatari by Hiroshi Aramata.\nMori is a character in the manga and anime adaptation of Bungo Stray Dogs.

An Italian exile provided him with plenty of sources and evidence, and exposed him to leading European scholars, and in 1913 he completed Nero: The Beast out of the Bottomless Pit (\"\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0438\u0437 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b. \u041d\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043d\", referring to Book of Revelation 11:7), a life story of Emperor Nero that evolved into a comprehensive encyclopedia of Rome at the end of Julio-Claudian dynasty and a critical review of contemporary historical concepts.  By 1913 Amfiteatrov's eyesight was failing to the point where he could not proofread and edit typographic print, relying more on his memory than on reading, thus the first edition was released with major errors and continuity gaps.  His second Roman study Arch of Titus, dedicated to early Christianity in Rome, was not completed.\nIn Italy he completed his most successful novels Vosmidesyatniki (The 80s-Niks) (1907\u201308) and Devyatidesyatniki (The 90s-Niks) (1911\u201313), dealing with the intelligentsia of the 1880s and 1890s, respectively.  \"Versatile and topical, but smartly superficial, Amfiteatrov catered for the general reader whose taste he knew to perfection\" (Cassell's Encyclopaedia of World Literature, ed. S.H. Steinberg, p.\u00a01680).\nIn 1916 Amfiteatrov returned to Russia and became editor of the nationalist newspaper Russkaya volya.  Because of his attacks on the government he was sent into exile in Irkutsk at the beginning of 1917, but after the February Revolution he returned to Petrograd, where he edited a Cossack newspaper and wrote articles attacking the Bolsheviks until the latter ended freedom of the press, whereupon he became a teacher and translator.  He left Russia with his family in August 1921.  Until the spring of 1922 he lived in Prague, then settled in Italy, where he wrote for many \u00e9migr\u00e9 journals.\nAmfiteatrov died in Levanto Italy in 1938. His sons were Vladimir Amfiteatrov-Kadashev, a writer and journalist (and friend of Nabokov); Daniele Amfitheatrof, a composer; and the musicians Maksim Amfiteatrov and Roman Amfiteatrov.\n\nNotes\nEnglish Translations\nNapoleonder, (Folk Tale), from Folk Tales of Napoleon: The Napoleon of the People and Napoleonder, The Outlook Company, NY, 1902.

He is best known for his influential supernatural, fantasy, and horror fiction. His novella The Great God Pan (1890; 1894) has garnered a reputation as a classic of horror, with Stephen King describing it as \"Maybe the best [horror story] in the English language.\" He is also well known for  \"The Bowmen\", a short story that was widely read as fact, creating the legend of the Angels of Mons.\n\nBiography\nEarly years\nMachen was born Arthur Llewelyn Jones in Caerleon, Monmouthshire. The house of his birth, opposite the Olde Bull Inn in The Square at Caerleon, is adjacent to the Priory Hotel and is today marked with a commemorative blue plaque. The beautiful landscape of Monmouthshire (which he usually referred to by the name of the medieval Welsh kingdom, Gwent), with its associations of Celtic, Roman, and medieval history, made a powerful impression on him, and his love of it is at the heart of many of his works.\nMachen was descended from a long line of clergymen, the family having originated in Carmarthenshire. In 1864, when Machen was two, his father John Edward Jones, became vicar of the parish of Llanddewi Fach with Llandegveth, about five miles north of Caerleon, and Machen was brought up at the rectory there. Jones had adopted his wife's maiden name, Machen, to inherit a legacy, legally becoming \"Jones-Machen\"; his son was baptised under that name and later used a shortened version of his full name, Arthur Machen, as a pen name.Local historian and folklorist Fred Hando traces Machen's interest in the occult to a volume of Household Words in his father's rectory library, in which he read, at the age of eight, an entrancing article on alchemy. Hando recounts Machen's other early reading:\n\n\nHe bought De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium Eater at Pontypool Road Railway Station, The Arabian Nights at Hereford Railway Station, and borrowed Don Quixote from Mrs. Gwyn, of Llanfrechfa Rectory. In his father's library he found also the Waverley Novels, a three-volume edition of the Glossary of Gothic Architecture, and an early volume of Tennyson.\n\nAt the age of eleven, Machen boarded at Hereford Cathedral School, where he received an excellent classical education. Family poverty ruled out attendance at university, and Machen was sent to London, where he sat exams to attend medical school but failed to get in. Machen, however, showed literary promise, publishing in 1881 a long poem \"Eleusinia\" on the subject of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Returning to London, he lived in relative poverty, attempting to work as a journalist, as a publisher's clerk, and as a children's tutor while writing in the evening and going on long rambling walks across London.In 1884 he published his second work, the pastiche The Anatomy of Tobacco, and secured work with the publisher and bookseller George Redway as a cataloguer and magazine editor. This led to further work as a translator from French, translating the Heptameron of Marguerite de Navarre, Le Moyen de Parvenir (Fantastic Tales) of B\u00e9roalde de Verville, and the Memoirs of Casanova. Machen's translations in a spirited English style became standard ones for many years.In 1887, the year his father died, Machen married Amelia (Amy) Hogg, an unconventional music teacher with a passion for the theatre, who had literary friends in London's bohemian circles. Hogg had introduced Machen to the writer and occultist A. E. Waite, who was to become one of Machen's closest friends. Machen also made the acquaintance of other literary figures, such as M. P. Shiel and Edgar Jepson. Soon after his marriage, Machen began to receive a series of legacies from Scottish relatives that allowed him to gradually devote more time to writing.\nLiterary decadence in the 1890s\nAround 1890 Machen began to publish in literary magazines, writing stories influenced by the works of Robert Louis Stevenson, some of which used gothic or fantastic themes. This led to his first major success, The Great God Pan. It was published in 1894 by John Lane in the noted Keynotes Series, which was part of the growing aesthetic movement of the time. Machen's story was widely denounced for its sexual and horrific content and consequently sold well, going into a second edition.\nMachen next produced The Three Impostors, a novel composed of a number of interwoven tales, in 1895. The novel and the stories within it were eventually to be regarded as among Machen's best works. However, following the scandal surrounding Oscar Wilde later that year, Machen's association with works of decadent horror made it difficult for him to find a publisher for new works. Thus, though he would write some of his greatest works over the next few years, some were published much later. These included The Hill of Dreams, Hieroglyphics, A Fragment of Life, the story \"The White People\", and the stories which make up Ornaments in Jade.\nTragedy and acting: 1899\u20131910\nIn 1899, Machen's wife Amy died of cancer after a long period of illness. This had a devastating effect on Machen. He only gradually recovered from his loss over the next year, partially through his close friendship with A. E. Waite. It was through Waite's influence that Machen joined at this time the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, though Machen's interest in the organization was not lasting or very deep.\nMachen's recovery was further helped by his sudden change of career, becoming an actor in 1901 and a member of Frank Benson's company of travelling players, a profession which took him round the country.\nThis led in 1903 to a second marriage, to Dorothie Purefoy Hudleston, which brought Machen much happiness. Machen managed to find a publisher in 1902 for his earlier written work Hieroglyphics, an analysis of the nature of literature, which concluded that true literature must convey \"ecstasy\". In 1906 Machen's literary career began once more to flourish as the book The House of Souls collected his most notable works of the nineties and brought them to a new audience. He also published a satirical work, Dr Stiggins: His Views and Principles, generally considered one of his weakest works.Machen also was at this time investigating Celtic Christianity, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Publishing his views in Lord Alfred Douglas's The Academy, for which he wrote regularly, Machen concluded that the legends of the Grail actually were based on dim recollections of the rites of the Celtic Church. These ideas also featured strongly in the novel The Secret Glory which he wrote at this time, marking the first use in fiction of the idea of the Grail's surviving into modern times in some form, an idea much utilised ever since, as by Charles Williams (War in Heaven), Dan Brown (The Da Vinci Code) and George Lucas (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). In 1907, The Hill of Dreams, generally considered Machen's masterpiece, was finally published, though it was not recognized much at the time.The next few years saw Machen continue with acting in various companies and with journalistic work, but he was finding it increasingly hard to earn a living and his legacies were long exhausted. Machen was also attending literary gatherings such as the New Bohemians and the Square Club.\nJournalism and the Great War: 1910\u20131921\nFinally Machen accepted a full-time journalist's job at Alfred Harmsworth's Evening News in 1910. In February 1912 his son Hilary was born, followed by a daughter Janet in 1917. The coming of war in 1914 saw Machen return to public prominence for the first time in twenty years due to the publication of \"The Bowmen\" and the subsequent publicity surrounding the \"Angels of Mons\" episode. He published a series of stories capitalizing on this success, most of which were morale-boosting propaganda, but the most notable, \"The Great Return\" (1915) and the novella The Terror (1917), were more accomplished. He also published a series of autobiographical articles during the war, later reprinted in book form as Far Off Things. During the war years Machen also met and championed the work of a fellow Welshman, Caradoc Evans.In general, though, Machen thoroughly disliked work at the newspaper, and it was only the need to earn money for his family which kept him at it. The money came in useful, allowing him to move in 1919 to a bigger house with a garden, in St John's Wood, which became a noted location for literary gatherings attended by friends such as the painter Augustus John, D. B. Wyndham Lewis, and Jerome K. Jerome. Machen's dismissal from the Evening News in 1921 came as a relief in one sense, though it caused financial problems. Machen, however, was recognized as a great Fleet Street character by his contemporaries, and he remained in demand as an essay writer for much of the twenties.\n\nThe Machen boom of the 1920s\nThe year 1922 saw a revival in Machen's literary fortunes. The Secret Glory, considered by some to be Machen's final masterpiece, was finally published, as was his autobiography Far Off Things, and new editions of Machen's Casanova, The House of Souls and The Hill of Dreams all came out. Machen's works had now found a new audience and publishers in America, and a series of requests for republications of books started to come in. Vincent Starrett, James Branch Cabell, and Carl Van Vechten were American Machen devotees who helped in this process.Another sign of his rising fortunes was the publication in 1923 of a collected edition of his works (the \"Caerleon Edition\") and a bibliography. That year also saw the publication of a recently completed second volume of autobiography, Things Near and Far\u2014the third and final volume, The London Adventure, being published in 1924. Machen's earlier works suddenly started becoming much-sought-after collectors' items at this time, a position they have held ever since. In 1924 he issued a collection of bad reviews of his own work, with very little commentary, under the title Precious Balms. In this period of prosperity Machen's home saw many visitors and social gatherings, and Machen made new friends, such as Oliver Stonor.\n\nFinal years: 1926\u20131947\nBy 1926 the boom in republication was mostly over, and Machen's income dropped. He continued republishing earlier works in collected editions, as well as writing essays and articles for various magazines and newspapers and contributing forewords and introductions to both his own works and those of other writers\u2014such as the Monmouthshire historian Fred Hando's The Pleasant Land of Gwent (1944)\u2014but produced little new fiction. In 1927, he became a manuscript reader for the publisher Ernest Benn, which brought in a much-needed regular income until 1933.\nIn 1929, Machen and his family moved away from London to Amersham in Buckinghamshire, but they still faced financial hardship. He received some recognition for his literary work when he received a Civil List pension of \u00a3100 per annum in 1932, but the loss of work from Benn's a year later made things difficult once more. A few more collections of Machen's shorter works were published in the thirties, partially as a result of the championing of Machen by John Gawsworth, who also began work on a biography of Machen that was only published in 2005 thanks to the Friends of Arthur Machen.Machen's financial difficulties were only finally ended by the literary appeal launched in 1943 for his eightieth birthday. The initial names on the appeal show the general recognition of Machen's stature as a distinguished man of letters, as they included Max Beerbohm, T. S. Eliot, Bernard Shaw, Walter de la Mare, Algernon Blackwood, and John Masefield. The success of the appeal allowed Machen to live the last few years of his life, until 1947, in relative comfort.\n\nViews\nSpiritual\nFrom the beginning of his literary career, Machen espoused a mystical belief that the humdrum ordinary world hid a more mysterious and strange world beyond. His gothic and decadent works of the 1890s concluded that the lifting of this veil could lead to madness, sex, or death, and usually a combination of all three. Machen's later works became somewhat less obviously full of gothic trappings, but for him investigations into mysteries invariably resulted in life-changing transformation and sacrifice. Machen loved the medieval world view because he felt it manifested deep spirituality alongside a rambunctious earthiness.Machen was a great enthusiast for literature that expressed the \"rapture, beauty, adoration, wonder, awe, mystery, sense of the unknown, desire for the unknown\" that he summed up in the word ecstasy. His main passions were for writers and writing he felt achieved this, an idiosyncratic list which included the Mabinogion and other medieval romances, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Miguel de Cervantes, William Shakespeare, Samuel Johnson, Thomas de Quincey, Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Allan Poe, and Robert Louis Stevenson. Those writers who failed to achieve this, or far worse did not even attempt it, received short shrift from Machen.Machen's strong opposition to a materialistic viewpoint is obvious in many of his works, marking him as part of neo-romanticism. He was deeply suspicious of science, materialism, commerce, and Puritanism, all of which were anathema to Machen's conservative, bohemian, mystical, and ritualistic temperament. Machen's virulent satirical streak against things he disliked has been regarded as a weakness in his work, and rather dating, especially when it comes to the fore in works such as Dr Stiggins. Similarly, some of his propagandistic First World War stories also have little appeal to a modern audience.Machen, brought up as the son of a Church of England clergyman, always held Christian beliefs, though accompanied by a fascination with sensual mysticism; his interests in paganism and the occult were especially prominent in his earliest works. Machen was well read on such matters as alchemy, the kabbalah, and Hermeticism, and these occult interests formed part of his close friendship with A. E. Waite. Machen, however, was always very down-to-earth, requiring substantial proof that a supernatural event had occurred, and was thus highly sceptical of Spiritualism. Unlike many of his contemporaries, such as Oscar Wilde and Alfred Douglas, his disapproval of the Reformation and his admiration for the medieval world and its Roman Catholic ritualism did not fully tempt him away from Anglicanism\u2014though he never fitted comfortably into the Victorian Anglo-Catholic world.The death of his first wife led him to a spiritual crossroads, and he experienced a series of mystical events. After his experimentation  with the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the orthodox ritual of the Church became ever more important to him, gradually defining his position as a High Church Anglican who was able to incorporate elements from his own mystical experiences, Celtic Christianity, and readings in literature and legend into his thinking.\nPolitical\nIn politics, Machen was reactionary. He stated in response to a 1937 questionnaire on the Spanish Civil War in the Left Review, \"Mr. Arthur Machen presents his compliments and begs to inform that he is, and always has been, entirely for General Franco.\"\nLegacy and influence\nMachen's literary significance is substantial; his stories have been translated into many languages and reprinted in short story anthologies countless times. In the sixties, a paperback reprint in the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series brought him to the notice of a new generation. More recently, the small press has continued to keep Machen's work in print. In 2010, to mark the 150 years since Machen's birth, two volumes of Machen's work were republished in the prestigious Library of Wales series.Literary critics such as Wesley D. Sweetser and S. T. Joshi see Machen's works as a significant part of the late Victorian revival of the gothic novel and the decadent movement of the 1890s, bearing direct comparison to the themes found in contemporary works like Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. At the time authors like Wilde, William Butler Yeats, and Arthur Conan Doyle were all admirers of Machen's works. He is also usually noted in the better studies of Anglo-Welsh literature. The French writer Paul-Jean Toulet translated Machen's The Great God Pan into French and visited Machen in London. Charles Williams was also a devotee of Machen's work, which inspired Williams' own fiction.Historian of fantastic literature Brian Stableford has suggested that Machen \"was the first writer of authentically modern horror stories, and his best works must still be reckoned among the finest products of the genre\".\nGenre fiction\nMachen's popularity in 1920s America has been noted, and his work was an influence on the development of the pulp horror found in magazines like Weird Tales and on such notable fantasy writers as James Branch Cabell, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard, Frank Belknap Long (who wrote a tribute to Machen in verse, \"On Reading Arthur Machen\"), Donald Wandrei, David Lindsay and E. Charles Vivian.His significance was recognized by H. P. Lovecraft, who in his essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\" named Machen as one of the four \"modern masters\" of supernatural horror (with Algernon Blackwood, Lord Dunsany, and M. R. James). Machen's influence on Lovecraft's own work was substantial. Lovecraft's reading of Machen in the early 1920s led him away from his earlier Dunsanian writing towards the development of what became the Cthulhu Mythos. Machen's use of a contemporary Welsh or London background in which sinister ancient horrors lurk and are capable of interbreeding with modern people obviously helped inspire Lovecraft's similar use of a New England background. Machen's story \"The White People\" includes references to curious unknown rites and beings, an idea Lovecraft uses frequently in the mythos.\nLovecraft pays tribute to the influence by directly incorporating some of Machen's creations and references, such as Nodens and Aklo, into his Cthulhu Mythos and using similar plotlines, most notably seen by a comparison of \"The Dunwich Horror\" to The Great God Pan and of \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" to \"The Novel of the Black Seal\". Other Lovecraft tales with a debt or reference to Machen include \"The Call of Cthulhu\", \"The Festival\", \"Cool Air\", \"The Descendant\", and \"The Colour Out of Space\".His intense, atmospheric stories of horror and the supernatural have been read and enjoyed by many modern horror and fantasy writers, influencing directly Peter Straub, Stephen King, Ramsey Campbell, Karl Edward Wagner, \"Sarban\" (John William Wall), Joanna Russ, Graham Joyce, Simon Clark, Tim Lebbon, and T. E. D. Klein, to name but a few. Klein's novel The Ceremonies was partly based on Machen's \"The White People\", and Straub's novel Ghost Story was influenced by The Great God Pan.\nWider literary influence\nMachen's influence is not limited to genre fiction, however. Jorge Luis Borges recognized Machen as a great writer, and through him Machen has had an influence on magic realism. He was also a major influence on Paul Bowles and Javier Mar\u00edas. He was one of the most significant figures in the life of the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, who attributed to Machen his conversion to High Church Anglicanism, an important part of his philosophy and poetry. Sylvia Townsend Warner (a niece of Machen's second wife, Purefoy) admired Machen and was influenced by him, as is his great-granddaughter, the contemporary artist Tessa Farmer.Machen was also a pioneer in psychogeography, due to his interest in the interconnection between landscape and the mind. His strange wanderings in Wales and London recorded in his beautiful prose make him of great interest to writers on this subject, especially those focusing on London, such as Iain Sinclair and Peter Ackroyd. Alan Moore wrote an exploration of Machen's mystical experiences in his work Snakes and Ladders. Aleister Crowley loved Machen's works, feeling they contained \"Magickal\" truth, and put them on the reading list for his students, though Machen, who never met him, detested Crowley. Other occultists, such as Kenneth Grant, also find Machen an inspiration. Far closer to Machen's personal mystical world view was his effect on his friend Evelyn Underhill, who reflected some of Machen's thinking in her highly influential book Mysticism.\nOne chapter of the French best-seller The Morning of the Magicians, by L. Pauwels and J. Berger (1960), deals extensively with Machen's thought and works. Machen's approach to reality is described as an example of the \"fantastic realism\" which the book is dedicated to.\n\nOther fields\nIn music, the composer John Ireland found Machen's works to be a life-changing experience that directly influenced much of his composition. Mark E. Smith of The Fall also found Machen an inspiration. Likewise, Current 93 have drawn on the mystical and occult leanings of Machen, with songs such as \"The Inmost Light\", which shares its title with Machen's story. Some artists on the Ghost Box Music label like Belbury Poly and The Focus Group draw heavily on Machen. It is an interest also shared by film directors like Mexican Rogelio A. Gonz\u00e1lez who made a successful version of \"The Islington Mystery\" as El Esqueleto de la se\u00f1ora Morales (1960), adapted by Luis Alcoriza, a frequent collaborator in Luis Bu\u00f1uel's classic films. This interest in Machen's works among filmmakers is also shared by Guillermo del Toro and Richard Stanley. Other notable figures with an enthusiasm for Machen have included Brocard Sewell, Barry Humphries, Stewart Lee and Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury.\nLiterary societies\nAn Arthur Machen Society was established in 1948 in the United States and survived until the 1960s. It was followed by the Arthur Machen Society based in the UK, in 1986, which in turn was replaced by the current literary society, The Friends of Arthur Machen.The Friends of Arthur Machen (FoAM) is a non-profit international literary society founded in 1998 dedicated to supporting interest in Arthur Machen and his work, and to aid research. It publishes two journals: Faunus, which reprints rare Machen articles and criticism of his work, and Machenalia. It fosters interest not only in Machen but in events in which he played a key part, such as the Angels of Mons affair, and organises psychogeographic excursions.\nProminent members include Javier Mar\u00edas, Stewart Lee and R.B. Russell of Tartarus Press. The society was nominated for a World Fantasy Special Award: Non-Professional in 2006.\n\nSelected works\nIn approximate order of composition, with date of publication:The Chronicle of Clemendy (1888): fantasy tales within a frame story of a rural Welsh drinking fraternity with mystical roots.\n\"The Lost Club\" (1890): short story about a secret London society and its ritual disappearances of members.\nThe Great God Pan (written 1890\u20131894; published 1894): short horror novel.

He later studied in Germany, and worked as a dramatic critic in New York City from 1890 to 1897. Like fellow-aesthete and good friend James Huneker, he helped bring fin-de-si\u00e8cle French authors to the attention of the American public. He also wrote a study on the ego entitled the Ego Book: a Book of Selfish Ideals (1914). A study of French authors with ties to the Symbolist movement was published in 1913, entitled French Portraits: Being Appreciations of the Writers of Young France. From 1895 to 1899, he co-edited the periodical M'lle New York with Huneker. Described as \"a highly idiosyncratic blend of serious analyses and presentations of European Symbolist literature and thought with buffoonery and incessant anti-philistinism\", it quickly became a manifesto for their cultural ideals.\nDieting\nThompson authored several books on healthy living, such as 1914's Eat and Grow Thin and 1916's Drink and Be Sober. \nHis diet book Eat and Grow Thin was popular, by 1931 it was in its 112th printing. It advocates a low-carbohydrate diet and contains a list of \"forbidden foods\". Thompson believed that dairy, pork, ham, bacon, beans, bread, grains, cereals, flour, rice, potatoes, sugar, and all alcoholic drinks should be avoided. He recommended eating all kinds of meat (except pig), game, sea-food, eggs, fruit and green vegetables. The book was criticized for misrepresenting nutritional science.Physician B. B. Vincent Lyon criticized Eat and Grow Thin for promoting a fad diet. Lyon noted that the high-protein content of the diet is dangerous for obese patients or those with cardiovascular or renal insufficiencies. Physiologist Graham Lusk commented that the advice from the book \"made so many of my friends so utterly miserable that I am sure that in the end it will counteract its own message.\"\nPublications\nFrench Portraits: Being Appreciations of the Writers of Young France (1900)\nSpinners of Life (1904)\nDiplomatic Mysteries (1905)\nThe Life of Ethelbert Nevin (1913)\nThe Ego Book: A Book of Selfish Ideals (1914)\nThe Night Watchman and Other Poems (1914)\nEat and Grow Thin: The Mahdah Menus (1914)\nDrink and Be Sober (1915)\nVerse (1915)\nThe Carnival of Destiny (1916)\nThe Peace Girl (1916)\nWoman (1917)\nLive and Be Young (1920)\nThe Pointed Tower (1923)\nThe Green Ray (1924)\nThe Scarlet Iris (1924)\nMr. Guelpa (1925)References\nExternal links\nScans of M'lle Yew York at the American Decadence website\n\n","48":"\n\nCharles Le Goffic (14 July 1863 \u2013 12 February 1932) was a Breton poet, novelist and historian whose influence was especially strong in his native Brittany. He was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.\n\nBiography\nBorn in Lannion, northern Brittany, his childhood was spent with his nurse, either in Perros-Guirec, or in Tr\u00e9gastel. In October 1888, he married Julie Fleury. Following a legal judgement in his favour he bought a farm at Run-Rouz in Tr\u00e9gastel. He worked as a teacher in Gap, \u00c9vreux, Nevers and in Le Havre. In 1886, he founded with Maurice Barr\u00e8s and Raymond de Tailh\u00e8de the literary review Les Chroniques. Goffic wrote widely about aspects of Breton and broader Celtic cultural identity, emphasising the importance of local traditions and cultural continuity. His short stories Passions Celtes (1910) were widely influential on the Breton cultural renaissance. One of them was dramatised by Le Goffic at the request of Guy Ropartz for the libretto of his opera Le Pays.Politically close to Charles Maurras, he collaborated on the Revue d'Action fran\u00e7aise (1899), which later became L'Action fran\u00e7aise (1908). Although a convinced republican, his militant regionalism and his traditionalist ideals led him to support the \"Maurrassisme\" project to restore the monarchy, as his letter published in L'Enqu\u00eate sur la monarchie (1900) testifies.\nGoffic was elected member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1930.\nIn 1895 he introduced the Great Highland Bagpipe to Brittany.\nHe is interred in the enclosure of the church of the borough of Tr\u00e9gastel, with his wife and their daughter, who died at the age of 17.\n\nBibliography\nNous autres (1879)\nVell\u00e9da (1882)\nLes M\u00e9moires de Saint-Simon, avec Jules Tellier (1888)\nAmour Breton, po\u00e9sie (1889)\nLes Romanciers d'aujourd'hui (1890)\nChansons bretonnes (1891)\nLe Crucifi\u00e9 de K\u00e9rali\u00e8s (1892)[1]\nPass\u00e9 l'amour (1894)\nContes de l'Assomption (1895)\nSur la c\u00f4te (1896)\nLa Payse (1897)\nMorgane (1888)\nLe Bois dormant, po\u00e9sie (1900)\nLe Pardon de la reine Anne, po\u00e9sie (1901)\nL'\u00e2me bretonne (4 vol., 1902\u20131922)\nLes M\u00e9tiers pittoresques (1903)\nL'Erreur de Florence (1903)\nLes Sept-Iles (1904)\nLes Calvaires Bretons (1904)\nLes Bonnets rouges (1906)\nLa Cigari\u00e8re (1907)\nPassions celtes (1909)\nLa double confession (1909)\nLa litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise au XIXe si\u00e8cle (1909)\nVent\u00f4se.

He founded and occupied the second chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, from 1897 until his death in 1934. He was also the president of the aforementioned Academy in 1926.\n\nLife\nCoelho Neto was born in the city of Caxias, Maranh\u00e3o, on February 21, 1864. His father was Portuguese, and his mother was an indigenous woman, Ana Silvestre Coelho.  At six years of age, his parents moved to Rio de Janeiro. He began his education at the Externato of the Colegio Pedro II. He attempted medical school but soon gave up. In 1883 he enrolled at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo School of Law, living in the boarding house where also lived Raul Pompeia, who attended the Academy of S\u00e3o Paulo at that time. He soon found himself involved in a student movement against a professor. In anticipation of reprisals, he moved to the Law Faculty of Recife, where he completed the first year of law, having been a student of the jurist and poet Tobias Barreto. Returning to S\u00e3o Paulo, he devoted himself passionately to the abolitionist and Republican campaign, an attitude that led to new frictions with the University of S\u00e3o Paulo School of Law. In 1885 he finally abandoned his legal studies and moved to Rio de Janeiro.\nHe became part of a group of bohemians that included figures such as Olavo Bilac, Lu\u00eds Murat, Guimar\u00e3es Passos and Francisco de Paula Ney. The history of this generation appears later in his novels A Conquista and Fogo F\u00e1tuo, dedicated to his friend Francisco de Paula Ney, a brilliant orator and journalist known for his bohemian life style and his famous anecdotes. He joined the newspaper Gazeta da Tarde, later moving to the sheet Cidade do Rio, where he held the position of secretary. From this period date his first published volumes.\nIn 1890, he married Maria Gabriela Brand\u00e3o, daughter of educator Alberto Olympio Brand\u00e3o. They had 14 children. One of those was the famous football player Jo\u00e3o Coelho Neto (known as \"Preguinho\").\nHe was appointed to the post of secretary of the government of the state of Rio de Janeiro and the following year, director of State Affairs. In 1892 he was appointed professor of art history at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (National School of Fine Arts) and, later, professor of literature at the Col\u00e9gio Pedro II. Author of numerous books, articles, stories and serials, he was appointed professor of history of theater and dramatic literature at the Escola de Arte Dram\u00e1tica (Drama School) in 1910, and soon after director of the same institution.\nHe was elected congressman for Maranh\u00e3o in 1909 and was reelected in 1917. He was also secretary-general of the League of National Defense and a member of the Advisory Board of the Municipal Theater of Rio de Janeiro.\nIn addition to holding public office, Coelho Neto maintained and intensified his activities in magazines and newspapers of all sizes, in Rio and other cities. In addition to signing works with his own name, he wrote under numerous pseudonyms, including Anselmo Ribas, Caliban, Ariel, Amador Santelmo, Blanco Canabarro, Charles Rouget, Democ, N. Puck, Tartarin, Fur-Fur and Man\u00e9s.\nIn 1923, he converted to Spiritualism, delivering a speech about his adoption of the spiritual doctrine in the Sal\u00e3o da Velha Guarda (Hall of the Old Guard) in Rio de Janeiro.\nHe was active in virtually all literary genres and was for many years the most widely read writer in Brazil.  He wrote what could have been the first Brazilian serial movie, The Mysteries of Rio de Janeiro.  However, only the first episode was ever completed.\nHe was probably the most widely read Brazilian writer in the first decades of the twentieth century.  However, he and his work were attacked by the Modernists during the Modern Art Week (or Semana de Arte Moderna, in Portuguese) in 1922 and this probably contributed to his later neglect by publishers and the Brazilian public.\n\nWorks\nRomance B\u00e1rbaro (1914)\nO Mist\u00e9rio (1920)\nFogo f\u00e1tuo, romance, (1929)\n\u00c1lbum de Caliban, contos, (1897)\nContos da vida e da morte, contos, (1927)\nMano, Livro da Saudade, romance, (1924)\nA cidade maravilhosa, contos, (1928)\nO polvo, romance (1924)\nA descoberta da \u00cdndia, narrativa hist\u00f3rica, (1898)\nO Fruto, contos, (1895)\nO rei fantasma, romance, (1895)\nO Raj\u00e1 de Pendjab (1898)\nRaps\u00f3dias, contos, (1891)\nSert\u00e3o (1897)\nA Bico de Penna\n\u00c1gua de Juventa, contos,\nRomanceiro (1898)\nTheatro, vol.

Among his other works are Le Plaisir de rompre (The Pleasure of Breaking, 1898) and the posthumously published Huit Jours \u00e0 la campagne (A Week in the Country, 1912). \n\nEarly life\nThe child of Fran\u00e7ois Renard and Anna-Rose Colin, Renard was born in Ch\u00e2lons-du-Maine, Mayenne where his father was working on the construction of a railroad. Renard grew up in Chitry-les-Mines, (Ni\u00e8vre). He had three older siblings including Am\u00e9lie (born 1858), who died at a young age. A second sister was also named Am\u00e9lie (born 1859). A third child, Maurice, was born before Pierre-Jules in 1862. Renard's childhood was characterized as difficult and sad (un grand silence roux or \"a great ruddy silence\"). Although he decided not to attend the prestigious \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure, love of literature would eventually dominate his life. From 1885\u201386, he served in the military in Bourges.\n\nLife and career\nOn 28 April 1888, Renard married Marie Morneau. He and his wife lived at 43 rue du Rocher in the 8th Arrondissement of Paris. He began to frequent literary caf\u00e9s and to contribute to Parisian newspapers. Among his steady friends were Alfred Capus and Lucien Guitry. Jules Renard wrote poems, short stories, short plays, novels and his famous Poil de carotte. He was elected mayor (maire) of Chitry on 15 May 1904 as the socialist candidate and became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt in 1907, thanks to Octave Mirbeau. He died of arteriosclerosis in Paris.\n\nWork\nSome of Jules Renard's works take their inspiration from the countryside he loved in the Ni\u00e8vre region. His character portraits are sharp, ironic and sometimes cruel (in his Histoires naturelles he humanizes animals and animalizes men) and he was an active supporter of pacifism and anticlericalism (apparent in La Bigote).His Journal, 1887\u20131910 (published in 1925) is a masterpiece of introspection, irony, humor and nostalgia, and provides an important glimpse into the literary life.\nThe English writer Somerset Maugham was influenced to publish his own well-known journals by the example of Renard. In the introduction to his own work A Writer's Notebook, Maugham wrote an apt summary of the virtues of Renard's journal: \"The journal is wonderfully good reading. It is extremely amusing. It is witty and subtle and often wise...Jules Renard jotted down neat retorts and clever phrases, epigrams, things seen, the sayings of people and the look of them, descriptions of scenery, effects of sunshine and shadow, everything, in short, that could be of use to him when he sat down to write for publication.\"The American novelist Gilbert Sorrentino based his 1994 work Red the Fiend on Renard's Poil de carotte. For a great part, the 2008 memoir Nothing to Be Frightened Of by the English novelist Julian Barnes is a homage to Jules Renard.\nRenard is one of several popular philosophers whose quotations appear on the road signs of Project HIMANK in the Ladakh region of northern India. On one such sign in the Nubra Valley, he is quoted as saying \"Laziness is nothing more than the habit of resting before you get tired\".\n\nWorks\nQuotes\nIt is not how old you are but how you are old.\nIf you are afraid of being lonely, don't try to be right.\nWriting is an occupation in which you have to keep proving your talent to people who have none.\nCulture is what's left after you have forgotten everything.\nI don't know if God exists, but it would be better for His reputation if He didn't.\nLook for the ridiculous in everything, and you will find it.\nIf money does not make you happy; give it back.\nWriting is the only way to talk without being interrupted.\nIf one were to build the house of happiness, the largest space would be the waiting room.\nDying serves no purpose so die now.\nThe horse is the only animal into which one can bang nails.\nWe don't understand life any better at forty than at twenty, but we know it and admit it.\nI find when I do not think of myself I do not think at all.\nFailure is not the only punishment for laziness; there is also the success of others.\nLaziness is nothing more than the habit of resting before you get tired.\nThe only man who is really free is the one who can turn down an invitation to dinner without giving an excuse.\nWriting is the only profession where no one considers you ridiculous if you earn no money.\nAs I grow to understand life less and less, I learn to love it more and more.\nI am never bored anywhere; being bored is an insult to oneself.\nIf I were to begin life again, I should want it as it was.

The contest was finally won by the Basque scholar Resurrecci\u00f3n Mar\u00eda de Azkue.Unamuno worked in all major genres: the essay, the novel, poetry, and theater, and, as a modernist, contributed greatly to dissolving the boundaries between genres. There is some debate as to whether Unamuno was in fact a member of the Generation of '98, an ex post facto literary group of Spanish intellectuals and philosophers that was the creation of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz (Azor\u00edn)\u2014a group that includes, besides Azor\u00edn, Antonio Machado, Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala, P\u00edo Baroja, Ram\u00f3n del Valle-Incl\u00e1n, Ramiro de Maeztu, and \u00c1ngel Ganivet, among others.Unamuno would have preferred to be a philosophy professor, but was unable to get an academic appointment; philosophy in Spain was somewhat politicized. Instead he became a Greek professor.In 1901 Unamuno gave his well-known conference on the scientific and literary inviability of the Basque. According to Azurmendi, Unamuno went against the Basque language once his political views changed as a result of his reflection on Spain.In addition to his writing, Unamuno played an important role in the intellectual life of Spain. He served as rector of the University of Salamanca for two periods: from 1900 to 1924 and 1930 to 1936, during a time of great social and political upheaval. During the 1910s and 1920s, he became one of the most passionate advocates of Spanish liberalism. Unamuno linked his liberalism with his hometown of Bilbao, which, through its commerce and connection with the civilized world, Unamuno believed had developed an individualism and independent outlook in stark contrast to the narrow-mindedness of Carlist traditionalism. When in 1912 Jos\u00e9 Canalejas was assassinated by an anarchist, he blamed it on the fact that Spain lacked a \"true liberal democratic party\" and in 1914 denounced the large property owners for their negligence and ignorance. Along with many other Spanish writers and intellectuals, such as Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s, he was an outspoken supporter of the Allied cause during the First World War despite Spain's official neutrality. Unamuno viewed the war as a crusade not just against the bellicose authoritarianism of the Germans, but against their sympathizers in Spain, and intensified his attacks on Alfonso XIII and the Spanish monarchy.Unamuno was removed from his two university chairs by the dictator General Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1924, over the protests of other Spanish intellectuals. As a result of his vociferous criticisms of Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, he lived in exile until 1930, first banished to Fuerteventura, one of the Canary Islands; his house there is now a museum, as is his house in Salamanca. From Fuerteventura he escaped to France, as related in his book De Fuerteventura a Paris. After a year in Paris, Unamuno established himself in Hendaye, a border town in the French Basque Country, as close to Spain as he could get while remaining in France. Unamuno returned to Spain after the fall of General Primo de Rivera's dictatorship in 1930 and took up his rectorship again. It is said in Salamanca that the day he returned to the University, Unamuno began his lecture by saying \"As we were saying yesterday...\" (Dec\u00edamos ayer...) as Fray Luis de Le\u00f3n had done in the same place in 1576, after four years of imprisonment by the Inquisition. It was as though he had not been absent at all. After the fall of Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, Spain embarked on its Second Republic. He was a candidate on the Republican\/Socialist ticket and was elected, after which he led a large demonstration in the Plaza Mayor in which he raised the Republic's flag and declared its victory. He always was a moderate and refused all political and anticlerical extremisms. In a speech delivered on 28 November 1932, at the Madrid Ateneo, he protested against Aza\u00f1a's extremist anti-clerical ruling: `Even the Inquisition was limited by certain legal guarantees. But now we have something worse: a police force which is grounded only on a general sense of panic and on the invention of non-existent dangers to cover up this over-stepping of the law.Unamuno's dislike for Manuel Aza\u00f1a's ruling went so far as to tell a reporter who published his statement in El Adelanto in June of 1936 that President Manuel Aza\u00f1a should commit suicide as a patriotic act\". The Republican government had a serious problem with Unamuno's statements, and on 22 August 1936, they decreed that Unamuno should once again be removed from his position as rector of the university. Moreover, the government removed his name from streets and replaced it with the name of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar.\nHaving begun his literary career as an internationalist, Unamuno gradually became convinced of the universal values of Spanish culture, feeling that Spain's essential qualities would be destroyed if influenced too much by outside forces. Thus he initially welcomed Franco's revolt as necessary to rescue Spain from the excesses of the Second Republic. When a journalist questioned how he could side with the military and \"abandon a Republic that [he] helped create,\" Unamuno responded, it \"is not a fight against the liberal Republic, but a fight for civilization. What Madrid represents now is not socialism or democracy, or even communism\"However, the harsh tactics employed by the Francoists in the struggle against their republican opponents caused him to oppose both the Republic and Franco. Unamuno said of the military revolt that it would be the victory of \"a brand of Catholicism that is not Christian and of a paranoid militarism bred in the colonial campaigns,\" referring in the latter case to the 1921 war with Abd el-Krim in what was then Spanish Morocco, (Franco's 1936 revolt also started from Spanish Morocco).\nIn 1936 Unamuno had a public quarrel with the Nationalist general Mill\u00e1n Astray at the university in which he denounced both Astray\u2014with whom he had had verbal battles in the 1920s\u2014and elements of the rebel movement. (see \u00a7\u00a0Confrontation with Mill\u00e1n Astray, below) Shortly afterwards, Unamuno was effectively removed for a second time from the rectorship of the University of Salamanca. A few days later he confided to Nikos Kazantzakis:\n\nNo, I have not become a right-winger. Pay no mind to what people say. No, I have not betrayed the cause of liberty. But for now, it's totally essential that order be restored. But one day I will rise up\u2014soon\u2014and throw myself into the fight for liberty, by myself. No, I am neither fascist nor Bolshevik. I am alone!...Like Croce in Italy, I am alone!\nOn 21 November, he wrote to the Italian philosopher Lorenzo Giusso that \"The barbarism is unanimous. It is a regime of terror on both sides.\" In one of his final letters, dated 13 December, he condemned the atrocities being committed by Franco's forces in terms that would become famous:\n\n\"[Franco's army] is waging a campaign against liberalism, not against Bolshevism [...] They will win, but they will not convince; they will conquer, but they will not convert.\"\nBroken-hearted, he was placed under house arrest by Franco, until his death.\nConfrontation with Mill\u00e1n Astray\nOn 12 October  1936, the Spanish Civil War had been underway for just under three months; the celebration of Columbus Day had brought together a politically diverse crowd at the University of Salamanca, including Enrique Pla y Deniel, the Archbishop of Salamanca, and Carmen Polo Mart\u00ednez-Vald\u00e9s, the wife of Franco, Falangist General Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Astray and Unamuno himself.\nUnamuno had supported Franco's uprising because he believed it necessary to bring order to the anarchy created by the Popular Front, and that day he was representing General Franco in the event. By then the Republican Government had removed Unamuno from his perpetual rectory at the Salamanca University and the rebel government had restored him.\nThere are different versions of the account\n\nThe Portillo\/Thomas version\nAccording to the British historian Hugh Thomas in his magnum opus The Spanish Civil War (1961), the evening began with an impassioned speech by the Falangist writer Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pem\u00e1n. After this, Professor Francisco Maldonado decried Catalonia and the Basque Country as \"cancers on the body of the nation,\" adding that \"Fascism, the healer of Spain, will know how to exterminate them, cutting into the live flesh, like a determined surgeon free from false sentimentalism.\"\nFrom somewhere in the auditorium, someone cried out the Spanish Legion\u00b4s motto \"\u00a1Viva la Muerte!\" [Long live death!]. As was his habit, Mill\u00e1n Astray, the founder and first commander of the Spanish Legion, responded with \"\u00a1Espa\u00f1a!\" [Spain!]; the crowd replied with \"\u00a1Una!\" [One!]. He repeated \"\u00a1Espa\u00f1a!\"; the crowd then replied \"\u00a1Grande!\" [Great!]. A third time, Mill\u00e1n Astray shouted \"\u00a1Espa\u00f1a!\"; the crowd responded \"Libre!\" [Free!] This\u2014Spain, one, great and free\u2014was a common Falangist cheer and would become a francoist motto thereafter. Later, a group of uniformed Falangists entered, saluting the portrait of Franco that hung on the wall.\nUnamuno, who was presiding over the meeting, rose up slowly and addressed the crowd:\n\nYou are waiting for my words. You know me well, and know I cannot remain silent for long. Sometimes, to remain silent is to lie, since silence can be interpreted as assent. I want to comment on the so-called speech of Professor Maldonado, who is with us here. I will ignore the personal offence to the Basques and Catalans. I myself, as you know, was born in Bilbao. The Bishop,\nUnamuno gestured to the Archbishop of Salamanca,\n\nwhether you like it or not, is Catalan, born in Barcelona. But now I have heard this insensitive and necrophilous oath, \"\u00a1Viva la Muerte!\", and I, having spent my life writing paradoxes that have provoked the ire of those who do not understand what I have written, and being an expert in this matter, find this ridiculous paradox repellent. General Mill\u00e1n Astray is a cripple. There is no need for us to say this with whispered tones. He is a war cripple. So was Cervantes. But unfortunately, Spain today has too many cripples. And, if God does not help us, soon it will have very many more. It torments me to think that General Mill\u00e1n Astray could dictate the norms of the psychology of the masses. A cripple, who lacks the spiritual greatness of Cervantes, hopes to find relief by adding to the number of cripples around him.\nMill\u00e1n Astray responded: \"Death to intelligence! Long live death!\" provoking applause from the Falangists. Pem\u00e1n, in an effort to calm the crowd, exclaimed \"No! Long live intelligence! Death to the bad intellectuals!\"\nUnamuno continued: \"This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win [vencer\u00e9is], because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince [pero no convencer\u00e9is]. In order to convince it is necessary to persuade, and to persuade you will need something that you lack: reason and right in the struggle. I see it is useless to ask you to think of Spain. I have spoken.\" Mill\u00e1n Astray, controlling himself, shouted \"Take the lady's arm!\" Unamuno took Carmen Polo by the arm and left under her protection.\n\nThe Severiano Delgado version\nIn 2018, the details of Unamuno's speech were disputed by the historian Severiano Delgado, who argued that the account in a 1941 article by Luis Gabriel Portillo (who was not present at Salamanca) in the British magazine Horizon may not have been an accurate representation of events.\nSeveriano Delgado, a historian and librarian at the University of Salamanca, asserts that Unamuno's  words were put in his mouth by Luis Portillo, in 1941, possibly with some help from George Orwell, in a piece in the literary magazine Horizon, entitled Unamuno's Last Lecture. Portillo had not witnessed the event.Severiano Delgado's book, titled \"Archeology of a Myth: The act of October 12, 1936 in the auditorium of the University of Salamanca,\" shows how the propaganda myth arose regarding the confrontation that took place that day between Miguel de Unamuno and the general Mill\u00e1n Astray.\nDelgado agrees that a \"very fierce and violent verbal confrontation\" between Unamuno and Mill\u00e1n Astray definitely occurred, which led to Unamuno being removed from his rectorship, but he thinks that the famous speech attributed to Unamuno was invented and written by Luis Portillo.\"Delgado says that:\n\nWhat Portillo did was to come up with a kind of liturgical drama, where you have an angel and a devil confronting one another. What he wanted to do above all was symbolise evil\u2014fascism, militarism, brutality\u2014through Mill\u00e1n Astray, and set it against the democratic values of the republicans\u2014liberalism and goodness\u2014represented by Unamuno. Portillo had no intention of misleading anyone; it was simply a literary evocation.\nUnamuno took the floor, not to confront Mill\u00e1n Astray, but to answer a previous speech by Professor of Literature Francisco Maldonado who had identified Catalonia and the Basque Country with the \"antiespa\u00f1a\" (Antispain}. Unamuno himself was Basque and was revolted with Francisco Maldonado's speech, but when addressing the audience, Unamuno used the example of what had happened with Jos\u00e9 Rizal (a Filipino nationalist and polymath during the tail end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines, executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine Revolution). Mill\u00e1n Astray had fought in the Philippines and it was the reference to Jos\u00e9 Rizal that annoyed Mill\u00e1n Astray, who shouted \"The traitoring intellectuals die\".\nAs proof that the incident was nothing more than a crossroads of hard words, the photograph reproduced on the cover of his book shows Mill\u00e1n Astray and Miguel de Unamuno calmly saying goodbye in the presence of Bishop Pl\u00e0, with no tension  between them. The photo was discovered in 2018 in the National Library and was part of the chronicle of the act that the newspaper \"The Advancement of Salamanca\" published the following day, 13 October 1936.According to Delgado, Portillo's account of the speech became famous when a then very young British historian Hugh Thomas, aged 30, came across it in a Horizon anthology while researching his seminal book, The Spanish Civil War, and mistakenly took it as a primary source.\nDeath\nUnamuno died  on 31 December 1936.The official version accounted that he died as a result of the inhalation of gases from a brazier. However, research by Colette Rabat\u00e9 and Jean-Claude Rabat\u00e9, released in 2020, suggests that he may have been murdered by Bartolom\u00e9 Arag\u00f3n, the last person to have visited him, based on the fact that he falsely claimed to be a former student of his, was a fascist militant (and requete) with opposed political ideas to Unamuno and had collaborated with Nationals propaganda before. Additional telltale findings were: the lack of autopsy (despite having been mandatory, as the cause of death was determined to be a sudden death due to a intracranial bleeding), two screams from Unamuno heard by his maid during the Arag\u00f3n visit and discrepancies in the time of death registered by the coroner and the authorities.\nLiterary career and works\nFiction\nPaz en la guerra (Peace in War) (1897)\u00a0\u2013 a novel that explores  the relationship of self and world through familiarity with death.  It is based on his experiences as a child during the Carlist siege of Bilbao in the Third Carlist War.\nAmor y pedagog\u00eda (Love and Pedagogy) (1902)\u00a0\u2013 a novel uniting comedy and tragedy in an absurd parody of positivist sociology.\nEl espejo de la muerte (The Mirror of Death) (1913)\u00a0\u2013 a collection of stories.\nNiebla (Mist) (1914)\u00a0\u2013 one of Unamuno's key works, which he called a nivola to distinguish it from the supposedly fixed form of the novel (novela in Spanish).\nVida de Don Quijote y Sancho (usually translated into English as Our Lord Don Quixote) (1914)\u00a0\u2013 another key work of Unamuno, often perceived as one of the earliest works applying existential elements to Don Quixote. The book, on Unamuno's own admission, is of mixed genre with elements of personal essay, philosophy, and fiction. Unamuno felt that Miguel de Cervantes had not told the story of Don Quijote very well, cluttering it with unrelated tales. Unamuno intended this work to present Cervantes' story the way it should have been written. He felt that as a quijotista (a fan or student of Don Quixote) he was superior to Cervantes. The work is primarily of interest to those studying Unamuno, not Cervantes.\nAbel S\u00e1nchez (1917)\u00a0\u2013 a novel that uses the story of Cain and Abel to explore envy.\nTulio Montalb\u00e1n (1920)\u00a0\u2013 a short novel on the threat of a man's public image undoing his true personality, a problem familiar to the famous Unamuno.\nTres novelas ejemplares y un pr\u00f3logo (Three Exemplary Novels and a Prologue) (1920)\u00a0\u2013 a much-studied work with a famous prologue. The title deliberately recalls the famous Novelas ejemplares of Miguel de Cervantes.\nLa t\u00eda Tula (Aunt Tula) (1921)\u00a0\u2013 his final large-scale novel, a work about maternity, a theme that he had already examined in Amor y pedagog\u00eda and Dos madres.\nTeresa (1924)\u00a0\u2013 a narrative work that contains romantic poetry, achieving an ideal through the re-creation of the beloved.\nC\u00f3mo se hace una novela (How to Make a Novel) (1927)\u00a0\u2013 the autopsy of an Unamuno novel.\nDon Sandalio, jugador de ajedrez (Don Sandalio, Chess Player) (1930).\nSan Manuel Bueno, m\u00e1rtir (Saint Emmanuel the Good, Martyr) (1930)\u00a0\u2013 a brief novella that synthesizes virtually all of Unamuno's thought. The novella centres on a heroic priest who has lost his faith in immortality, yet says nothing of his doubts to his parishioners, not wanting to disturb their faith, which he recognizes is a necessary support for their lives.Philosophy\nUnamuno's philosophy was not systematic but rather a negation of all systems and an affirmation of faith \"in itself.\" He developed intellectually under the influence of rationalism and positivism, but during his youth he wrote articles that clearly show his sympathy for socialism and his great concern for the situation in which he found Spain at the time. An important concept for Unamuno was intrahistoria. He thought that history could best be understood by looking at the small histories of anonymous people, rather than by focusing on major events such as wars and political pacts. Some authors relativize the importance of intrahistoria in his thinking. Those authors say that more than a clear concept is an ambiguous metaphor. The term first appears in the essay En torno al casticismo (1895), but Unamuno leaves it soon.\nIn the late nineteenth century Unamuno suffered a religious crisis and left the positivist philosophy. Then, in the early twentieth century, he developed his own thinking influenced by existentialism. Life was tragic, according to Unamuno, because of the knowledge that we are to die. He explains much of human activity as an attempt to survive, in some form, after our death. Unamuno summarized his personal creed thus: \"My religion is to seek for truth in life and for life in truth, even knowing that I shall not find them while I live.\" He said, \"Among men of flesh and bone there have been typical examples of those who possess this tragic sense of life. I recall now Marcus Aurelius, St. Augustine, Pascal, Rousseau, Ren\u00e9, Obermann, Thomson, Leopardi, Vigny, Lenau, Kleist, Amiel, Quental, Kierkegaard\u2014men burdened with wisdom rather than with knowledge.\" He provides a stimulating discussion of the differences between faith and reason in his most famous work: Del sentimiento tr\u00e1gico de la vida (The Tragic Sense of Life, 1912).\nA historically influential paperfolder from childhood to his last, difficult days, in several works Unamuno ironically expressed philosophical views of Platonism, scholasticism, positivism, and the \"science vs religion\" issue in terms of \"origami\" figures, notably the traditional Spanish pajarita. Since he was also a linguist (professor of Greek), he coined the word \"cocotolog\u00eda\" (\"cocotology\") to describe the art of paper folding. After the conclusion of Amor y pedagog\u00eda (Love and Pedagogy, 1902), he included in the volume, attributing it to one of the characters, \"Notes for a Treatise on Cocotology\" (\"Apuntes para un tratado de cocotolog\u00eda\").Along with The Tragic Sense of Life, Unamuno's long-form essay La agon\u00eda del cristianismo (The Agony of Christianity, 1931) and his novella San Manuel Bueno, m\u00e1rtir (Saint Emmanuel the Good, Martyr, 1930) were all included on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.After his youthful sympathy for socialism ended, Unamuno gravitated towards liberalism. Unamuno's conception of liberalism, elaborated in essays such as La esencia del liberalismo in 1909, was one that sought to reconcile a great respect for individual freedom with a more interventionist state, bringing him to a position closer to social liberalism. In writing about the Church in 1932 during the second Spanish Republic, Unamuno urged the clergy to end their attacks on liberalism and instead embrace it as a way of rejuvenating the faith.\nUnamuno was probably  the best Spanish connoisseur of Portuguese culture, literature, and history of his time. He believed it was as important for a Spaniard to become familiar with the great names of Portuguese literature as with those of Catalan literature. He believed that Iberian countries should come together through the exchange of manifestations of the spirit but he was openly against any type of Iberian Federalism.In the final analysis Unamuno's significance is that he was one of a number of notable interwar intellectuals, along with Julien Benda, Karl Jaspers, Johan Huizinga, and Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset, who resisted the intrusion of ideology into Western intellectual life.\nPoetry\nFor Unamuno, the art of poetry was a way of expressing spiritual problems. His themes were the same in his poetry as in his other fiction: spiritual anguish, the pain provoked by the silence of God, time and death.\nUnamuno was always attracted to traditional meters and, though his early poems did not rhyme, he subsequently turned to rhyme in his later works.\nAmong his outstanding works of poetry are:\n\nPoes\u00edas (Poems) (1907)\u00a0\u2013 his first collection of poetry, in which he outlined the themes that would dominate his poetics: religious conflict, Spain, and domestic life\nRosario de sonetos l\u00edricos (Rosary of Lyric Sonnets) (1911)\nEl Cristo de Vel\u00e1zquez (The Christ of Vel\u00e1zquez) (1920)\u00a0\u2013 a religious work, divided into four parts, where Unamuno analyzes the figure of Christ from different perspectives: as a symbol of sacrifice and redemption, as a reflection on his Biblical names (Christ the myth, Christ the man on the cross, Christ, God, Christ the Eucharist), as poetic meaning, as painted by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, etc.\nAndanzas y visiones espa\u00f1olas (1922)\u00a0\u2013 something of a travel book, in which Unamuno expresses profound emotion and experiments with landscape both evocative and realistic (a theme typical of his generation of writers)\nRimas de dentro (Rhymes from Within) (1923)\nRimas de un poeta desconocido (Rhymes from an Unknown Poet) (1924)\nDe Fuerteventura a Par\u00eds (From Fuerteventura to Paris) (1925)\nRomancero del destierro (Ballads of Exile) (1928)\nCancionero (Songbook) (1953, published posthumously)Drama\nUnamuno's dramatic production presents a philosophical progression.\nQuestions such as individual spirituality, faith as a \"vital lie\", and the problem of a double personality were at the center of La esfinge (The Sphinx) (1898), and La verdad (Truth), (1899).\nIn 1934, he wrote El hermano Juan o El mundo es teatro (Brother Juan or The World is a Theatre).\nUnamuno's theatre is schematic; he did away with artifice and focused only on the conflicts and passions that affect the characters. This austerity was influenced by classical Greek theatre. What mattered to him was the presentation of the drama going on inside of the characters, because he understood the novel as a way of gaining knowledge about life.\nBy symbolizing passion and creating a theatre austere both in word and presentation, Unamuno's theatre opened the way for the renaissance of Spanish theatre undertaken by Ram\u00f3n del Valle-Incl\u00e1n, Azor\u00edn, and Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca.\n\nIn popular culture\nIn the 2015 documentary La isla del viento, directed by Manuel Mench\u00f3n, Unamuno is played by Jos\u00e9 Luis G\u00f3mez and his 1924 exile in Fuerteventura due to his critics to Primo de Rivera is depicted.\nThe 2019 film While at War shows Unamuno (played by Karra Elejalde) between 18 July 1936 and his death.\nIn the TV series Star Trek: Picard, the pilot Chris Rios has a book copy of The Tragic Sense of Life on the ship's dashboard.See also\nThinking about the immortality of the crab\nRafael Moreno Aranzadi \u2013 his nephew, footballer also known as PichichiReferences\nFurther reading\n\u00c1lvarez, Jos\u00e9 Luis. 1966: \"Unamuno ala Jammes?\", Jakin, 21: 81\u201384.\nAzurmendi, Joxe. 2006: \"Unamuno\" in Espainiaren arimaz, Donostia: Elkar.

Kilkenny in 1865, to Charlotte Emily Henrietta Mayne (n\u00e9e Sweetman) and Charles Edward Bolton Mayne. The family was originally from Monaghan. Her father was a member (from 1858) of the Royal Irish Constabulary. Her mother's father Captain William Sweetman was in the 16th Lancers. The family moved to Kinsale in Co. Cork and then to Cork, where her father was appointed a resident magistrate to the city.She attended private schools in Ireland.Mayne's first published work came when in 1895, aged 30, she submitted a short story to the recently established literary periodical The Yellow Book.\nThe editor Henry Harland accepted it, writing her an effusive letter, and the story, \"A Pen-and-ink Effect\", appeared in July 1895 in Volume 6 of the periodical, under the pen name Frances E. Huntley.\nIn September 1895, her short story \"Her Story and His\" was published in Chapman's Magazine of Fiction, under the same pen name.\nLater that year, in December, Harland invited Mayne to become sub-editor of The Yellow Book (to replace Ella D'Arcy, who had gone to France) and Mayne moved to London on 1 January 1896 to take up the post.\nAnother short story, \"Two Stories\", appeared in the January 1896 edition of The Yellow Book, again under the Huntley pen name.\nShe was much influenced by Harland, but tensions arose when D'Arcy returned in the spring and set about undermining her position at the periodical, and when Harland refused to intervene, Mayne gave up and returned to Cork.She continued writing and in 1898 published her first collection of short-stories, The Clearer Vision, this time under her own name. The title derives from a favourite phrase of Harland's, \"the clearer vision of the writer\". She published her first novel, Jessie Vandeleur in 1902. That year her mother died, and she was left to look after her father and her invalid sister Violet.In 1905 her father retired, and the family moved to London, residing in Holland Road, Kensington.\nShe published her first translation, anonymously, in 1907: The Diary of a Lost One by the German writer Margarete B\u00f6hme, a purported true-life diary of a girl forced into prostitution and a best-selling sensation at the time.\nShe published her second novel, The Fourth Ship, in 1908, and also published her first French translation, a work of the French historian Jules-Auguste Lair on Louise de La Valli\u00e8re, mistress of Louis XIV. She would continue publishing translations of French and German works throughout her life.\nIn 1909 she published her first biographical work, Enchanters of Men, \"studies of two dozen sirens from Diane de Poitiers to Adah Isaacs Menken\". In 1912, in what became a specialist subject for her, she published a two-volume biography of Byron, which was well-received, and became her best known work. She followed this in 1913 with a literary study of Robert Browning, Browning's Heroines.\nHer fourth and last novel, One of Our Grandmothers, was published in 1916.\nMayne was an active all-round journalist, reviewing fiction for The Nation and The Daily News, and writing articles for the Daily Chronicle and The Yorkshire Post. In the 1920s and 1930s she was on the English committee of the Prix Femina, a French literary prize with an all-female panel, and president 1924-25.She published her sixth and final collection of short stories, Inner Circle, in 1925.\nIn January 1927 her father died, which meant the loss of his pension, and left the family, which included Violet and a brother-in-law, dependent on her literary income.\nNow in her sixties, she was granted a small civil list pension in March that year for \"services to literature\".\nThe family moved from Kensingston to Richmond and then to near-by St. Margarets, in Twickenham, where she continued her literary work, and found recreation in \"walking, reading and playing patience\".In 1929 she published The Life and Letters of Anne Isabella, Lady Noel Byron, on Lady Noel Byron, Byron's wife, and continuing her speciality, published a translation of Charles du Bos's Byron et le besoin de la fatalit\u00e9 in 1932.\nIn 1939, aged 74, she published her final work, A Regency Chapter; Lady Bessborough and Her Friendships, a study of the Countess of Bessborough, the mother of Byron's mistress Lady Caroline Lamb. In May that year she was granted a pension by the Royal Literary Fund.

A seminal figure of the Silver Age of Russian Poetry, regarded as a co-founder of the Symbolist movement, Merezhkovsky \u2013 with his wife, the poet Zinaida Gippius \u2013 was twice forced into political exile. During his second exile (1918\u20131941) he continued publishing successful novels and gained recognition as a critic of the Soviet Union. Known both as a self-styled religious prophet with his own slant on apocalyptic Christianity, and as the author of philosophical historical novels which combined fervent idealism with literary innovation, Merezhkovsky became a nine-time nominee for the Nobel Prize in literature, which he came closest to winning in 1933.\nBiography\nDmitry Sergeyevich Merezhkovsky was born on August 2, 1866, in Saint Petersburg, the sixth son in the family. His father Sergey Ivanovich Merezhkovsky served as a senior official in several Russian local governors' cabinets (including that of I.D.Talyzin in Orenburg) before entering Alexander II's court office as a Privy Councillor. His mother Varvara Vasilyevna Merezhkovskaya (n\u00e9e Tcherkasova) was a daughter of a senior Saint Petersburg security official. Fond of arts and literature, she was what Dmitry Merezhkovsky later remembered as the guiding light of his rather lonely childhood (despite the presence of five brothers and three sisters around). There were only three people Merezhkovsky had any affinity with in his whole lifetime, and his mother, a woman \"of rare beauty and angelic nature\" according to biographer Yuri Zobnin, was the first and the most important of them.\nEarly years\nDmitry Merezhkovsky spent his early years on the Yelagin Island in Saint Petersburg, in a palace-like cottage which served as a summer dacha for the family. In the city the family occupied an old house facing the Summer Gardens, near Prachechny Bridge. The Merezhkovskys also owned a large estate in Crimea, by a road leading to the Uchan-Su waterfall. \"Fabulous Oreanda palace, now in ruins, will stay with me forever. White marble pylons against the blue sea... for me it's a timeless symbol of Ancient Greece,\" he wrote years later. Sergey Merezhkovsky, although a man of means, led an ascetic life, keeping his household 'lean and thrifty'. He saw this also as 'moral prophylactics' for his children, regarding luxury-seeking and reckless spending as the two deadliest sins. The parents traveled a lot, and an old German housekeeper Amalia Khristianovna spent much time with the children, amusing them with Russian fairytales and Biblical stories. It was her recounting of saints' lives that helped Dmitry to develop fervent religious feelings in his early teens.In 1876 Dmitry Merezhkovsky joined an elite grammar school, the St. Petersburg Third Classic Gymnasium. Years spent there he described later by one word, \"murderous\", remembering just one teacher as a decent person \u2013 \"Kessler the Latinist; well-meaning he surely never was, but at least had a kindly look.\" At thirteen Dmitry started writing poetry, rather in the vein of Pushkin's \"Bakhchisarai Fountain\" as he later remembered. He became fascinated with the works of Moli\u00e8re to such an extent as to form a Moli\u00e8re Circle in the Gymnasium. The group had nothing political on its agenda, but still made the secret police interested. All of its members were summoned one by one to the Third Department's headquarters by the Politzeisky Bridge to be questioned. It is believed that only Sergey Merezhkovsky's efforts prevented his son from being expelled from the school.\nDebut\nMuch as Dmitry disliked his tight upper-lipped, stone-faced father, later he had to give him credit for being the first one to have noticed and, in his emotionless way, appreciate his first poetic exercises. In July 1879, in Alupka, Crimea, Sergey Ivanovich introduced Dmitry to the legendary Princess Yekaterina  Vorontzova, once Pushkin's sweetheart. The grand dame admired the boy's verses: she (according to a biographer) \"spotted in them a must-have poetic quality: the metaphysical sensitivity of a young soul\" and encouraged him to soldier on. Somewhat different was young Merezhkovsky's encounter with another luminary, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, staged by his well-connected father again. As the boy started reciting his work, nervous to the point of stuttering, the famous novelist listened rather impatiently, then said: \"Poor, very poor. To write well, one has to suffer. Suffer!\" \u2013 \"Oh no, I'd rather he won't \u2013 either suffer, or write well!\", the appalled father exclaimed. The boy left Dostoyevsky's house much frustrated by the great man's verdict. Merezhkovsky's debut publication followed the same year: Saint Petersburg magazine Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye published two of his poems, \"Little Cloud\" and \"The Autumn Melody\". A year later another poem \"Narcissus\" was included in a charity compilation benefiting destitute students, edited by Pyotr Yakubovich.In Autumn 1882 Merezhkovsky attended one of the first of Semyon Nadson's public readings and, deeply impressed, wrote him a letter. Soon Nadson became Merezhkovsky's closest friend \u2013 in fact, the only one, apart from his mother. Later researchers suggested there was some mystery shared by the two young men, something to do with \"fatal illness, fear of death and longing for faith as an antidote to such fear.\" Nadson died in 1887, Varvara Vasilyevna two years later; feeling that he's lost everything he'd ever had in this world, Merezhkovsky submerged into deep depression.In January 1883 Otechestvennye Zapiski published two more of Merezhkovsky's poems. \"Sakya Muni\", the best known of his earlier works, entered popular poetry recital compilations of the time and made the author almost famous. By 1896 Merezhkovsky was rated as \"a well known poet\" by the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary. Years later, having gained fame as a novelist, he felt embarrassed by his poetry and, while compiling his first Complete series in the late 1900s, cut the poetry section down to several pieces. Nevertheless, Merezhkovsky's poems remained popular, and some major Russian composers, Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky among them, have set dozens of them to music.\nUniversity years\nIn 1884\u20131889 Merezhkovsky studied history and philology at the University of Saint Petersburg where his PhD was on Montaigne. He learned several foreign languages and developed strong interest in the French literature, the philosophy of positivism, theories of John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin. Still, his student years were joyless. \"University gave me no more than a Gymnasium did. I've never had proper \u2013 either family, or education,\" he wrote in his 1913 autobiography. The only lecturer he remembered fondly was the historian of literature Orest Miller, who held a domestic literature circle.In 1884 Merezhkovsky (along with Nadson) joined the Saint Petersburg's Literary Society, on Aleksey Pleshcheyev's recommendation. The latter introduced the young poet to the family of Karl Davydov, head of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His wife Anna Arkadyevna became Merezhkovsky's publisher in the 1890s, their daughter Julia \u2013 his first (strong, even if fleeting) romantic interest. In Davydov's circle Merezhkovsky mixed with well-established literary figures of the time \u2013 Ivan Goncharov, Apollon Maykov, Yakov Polonsky, but also Nikolay Mikhaylovsky and Gleb Uspensky, two prominent narodniks whom he regarded later as his first real teachers.It was under the guidance of the latter that Merezhkovsky, while still a university student, embarked upon an extensive journey through the Russian provinces where he met many people, notably religious cults leaders. He stayed for some time in Chudovo village where Uspensky lived, and both men spent many sleepless nights discussing things like \"life's religious meaning,\" \"a common man's cosmic vision\" and \"the power of the land.\" At the time he was seriously considering leaving the capital to settle down in some far-out country place and become a teacher.Another big influence was Mikhaylovsky, who introduced the young man to the staff of Severny Vestnik, a literary magazine he founded with Davydova. Here Merezhkovsky met Vladimir Korolenko and Vsevolod Garshin, and later Nikolai Minsky, Konstantin Balmont and Fyodor Sologub: the future leaders of the Russian Symbolism movement. Merezhkovsky's first article for the magazine, \"A Peasant in the French literature\", upset his mentor: Mikhaylovsky spotted in his young  prot\u00e9g\u00e9 the \"penchant for mysticism,\" something he himself was averse to.In the early 1888 Merezhkovsky graduated from the University and  embarked upon a tour through southern Russia, starting in Odessa. In Borjomi he met 19-year-old poet Zinaida Gippius. The two fell in love and on January 18, 1889, married in Tiflis, making arguably the most prolific and influential couple in the history of Russian literature. Soon husband and wife moved into their new Saint Petersburg house, Merezkovsky's mother's wedding present.\nLate 1880s to early 1890s\nMerezhkovsky's major literary debut came with the publication of Poems (1883\u20131888). It brought the author into the focus of the most favourable critical attention, but \u2013 even coupled with Protopop Avvacum, a poetry epic released the same year, could not solve young family's financial problems. Helpfully, Gippius unexpectedly reinvented herself as a prolific fiction writer, starting to churn out novels and novelettes she couldn't later even remember the titles of. Sergey Merezhkovsky's occasional hand-outs also helped the husband and wife to keep their meagre budget afloat.Having by this time lost interest in poetry, Dmitry Merezhkovsky developed a strong affinity to Greek drama and published translations of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides in Vestnik Evropy. These and some of his later translations from Ancient Greek (like prose version of Daphnis and Chloe, 1896), almost unnoticed by the contemporary critics, later came to be regarded (according to biographer Yuri Zobnin) \"the pride of the Russian school of classical translation.\"In the late 1880s Merezhkovsky debuted as a literary critic with an essay on Anton Chekhov entitled \"A Newly-born Talent Facing the Same Old Question\" and published by Severny Vestnik. Having spotted in his subject's prose \"the seeds of irrational, alternative truth,\" Merezhkovsky inadvertently put an end to his friendship with Mikhaylovsky and amused Chekhov who, in his letter to Pleshcheev, mentioned the \"disturbing lack of simplicity\" as the article's major fault. Merezhkovsky continued in the same vein and thus invented (in retrospect) the whole new genre of a philosophical essay as a form of critical thesis, something unheard of in Russian literature before. Merezhkovsky's biographical pieces on Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Goncharov, Maykov, Korolenko, Pliny, Calderon scandalized the contemporary literary establishment. Later, compiled in a volume called The Eternal Companions, these essays were pronounced modern classics, their author praised as \"the subtlest and the deepest of late XIX \u2013 early XX Russian literary critics\" by literary historian Arkady Dolinin. The Eternal Companions became so revered a piece of literary art in the early 1910s that the volume was officially chosen as an honorary gift for excelling grammar school graduates.\nIn May 1890 Liubov Gurevich, the new head of the revamped Severny Vestnik, turned a former narodnik's safe haven into the exciting club for members of the rising experimental literature scene, labeled \"decadent\" by detractors. Merezhkovsky's new drama Sylvio was published there, the translation of Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven followed suit. Other journals became interested in the young author too: Russkaya Mysl published his poem Vera (later included in his The Symbols compilation), hailed as one of the Russian Symbolism's early  masterpieces, its colourful mysticism providing a healthy antidote to narodniks's \"reflections\" of the social life. Bryusov \"absolutely fell in love with it,\" and Pyotr Pertsov years later admitted: \"For my young mind Merezhkovsky's Vera sounded so much superior to this dull and old-fashioned Pushkin\".Russkaya Mysl released The Family Idyll (Semeynaya idillia, 1890), a year later another symbolic poem Death (Smert) appeared in Severny Vestnik. In 1891 Merezhkovsky and Gippius made their first journey to Europe, staying mostly in Italy and France; the poem End of the Century (Konetz Veka) inspired by the European trip, came out two years later. On their return home the couple stayed for a while in Guppius' dacha at Vyshny Volochyok; it was here that Merezhkovsky started working on his first novel, The Death of the Gods. Julian the Apostate. A year later it was finished, but by this time the situation with Severny Vestnik had changed: outraged by Akim Volynsky's intrusive editorial methods, Merezhkovsky severed ties with the magazine, at least for a while. In the late 1891 he published his translation of Sophocles' Antigone in Vestnik Evropy, part of Goethe's Faustus (in Russkoye Obozrenye) and Euripides' Hyppolite (in Vestnik Evropy again). The latter came out in 1893, after the couple's second trip to Europe where their first encounter with Dmitry Filosofov occurred. Merezhkovsky's vivid impressions of Greece and the subsequent spurt of the new ideas provided the foundation for his second novel.\nThe Symbolism manifests\nIn 1892 Merezhkovsky's second volume of poetry entitled Symbols. Poems and Songs came out. The book, bearing E.A.Poe and Charles Baudelaire's influences but also tinged with the author's newly found religious ideas, became a younger readership's favourite. Of the elder writers only Yakov Polonsky supported it wholeheartedly. In October 1892 Merezhkovsky's lecture \"The Causes of the Decline of the Contemporary Russian Literature and the New Trends in it\" was first read in public, then came out in print. Brushing aside the 'decadent' tag, the author argued that all three \"streaks of Modern art\" \u2014 \"Mystic essence, Symbolic language and Impressionism\" \u2014 could be traced down to the works of Lev Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky, Russian Modernism, therefore, being a continuation of the Russian literature's classic tradition. Coupled with Symbols, the lecture was widely accepted as Russian symbolism's early manifest. The general reaction to it was mostly negative. The author found himself between the two fires: liberals condemned his ideas as \"the new obscurantism,\" members of posh literary salons treated his revelations with scorn. Only one small group of people greeted \"The Causes\" unanimously, and that was the staff of Severny Vestnik, which welcomed him back.In 1893\u20131894 Merezhkovsky published numerous books (the play The Storm is Over and the translation of Sophocles' Oedipus the King among them), but the money all this hard work brought were scant. Now writing his second novel, he had to accept whatever work was offered to him. In the late 1893 Merezhkovskys settled in Saint Petersburg again. Here they frequented the Shakespearean Circle, the Polonsky's Fridays and the Literary Fund gatherings. Then the pair started their own home salon with Filosofov and Akim Volynsky becoming habitu\u00e9s. All of a sudden Merezhkovsky found that his debut novel was to be published in Severny Vestnik after all. What he didn't realise was that this came as a result of a Gippius' tumultuous secret love affair with Akim Volynsky, one of this magazine's chiefs.\n1895\u20131903\nThe Death of the Gods which came out in 1895 (Severny Vestnik, Nos.1\u20136) opened the Christ & Antichrist trilogy and in retrospect is regarded as the first Russian symbolist novel. Sceptics prevailed (most of them denouncing the author's alleged Nietzscheanity), but the allies were ecstatic. \"A novel made for eternity,\" Bryusov marveled. Five years later Julian the Apostate was published in France, translated by Zinaida Vasilyeva.Merezhkovsky's relationship with Severny Vestnik, though, again started to deteriorate, the reason  being Akim Volynsky's jealousy. In 1896 all three of them (husband still unaware of what was going on behind his back) made a trip to Europe to visit Leonardo da Vinci's places. Several ugly rows with Volynsky finally prompted Gippius to send her scandalous-minded lover home. Volynsky reacted by expelling his ex-lover's husband from Severny Vestnik (some sources say it was the Merezhkovskys who withdraw their cooperation with the \"Severny Vestnik\" a year before the magazine shut down in 1898, along with Minsky and Sologub), made sure the major literary journals would shut the door on him and published (in 1900) under his own name a monograph Leonardo da Vinci, written and compiled by his adversary.The scandal concerning plagiarism lasted for almost two years. Feeling sick and ignored, Merezhkovsky in 1897 was seriously considering leaving his country for good, being kept at home only by the lack of money. For almost three years the second novel, Resurrection of Gods. Leonardo da Vinci (The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci \u2013 in English and French) remained unpublished. It finally appeared in Autumn 1900 in Mir Bozhy under the title \"The Renaissance\". In retrospect these two books' \"...persuasive power came from Merezhkovsky's success in catching currents then around him: strong contrasts between social life and spiritual values, fresh interest in the drama of pagan ancient Athens, and identification with general western European culture.\"By the time of his second novel's release Merezhkovsky was in a different cultural camp \u2013 that of Dyagilev and his close friends \u2013 Alexandre Benois, L\u00e9on Bakst, Nikolay Minsky and Valentin Serov. Their own brand new Mir Iskusstva (World of Art) magazine, with Dmitry Filosofov as a literary editor, accepted Merezhkovsky wholeheartedly. It was here that his most famous essay, L. Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky  was published in 1900\u20131901, coinciding with the escalation of Tolstoy's conflict with the Russian Orthodox church. Tolstoy invited the couple to his Yasnaya Polyana estate in 1904 and, to both parties' delight, the visit proved to be friendly. Behind the facade, there was little love lost between them; the old man confessed in his diary that, he just couldn't \"force himself to love those two,\" and Merezhkovsky's critique of what he saw as \"Tolstoy's nihilism\" continued.\nThe God-seekers and Troyebratstvo\nIn the early 1900s Merezhkovskys formed the group called the Religious-Philosophical Meetings (1901\u20131903) based on the concept of the New Church which was suggested by Gippius and supposed to become an alternative to the old Orthodox doctrine, \"...imperfect and prone to stagnation.\" The group, organized by Merezhkovsky and Gippius along with Vasily Rozanov, Viktor Mirolyubov and Valentin Ternavtsev, claimed to provide \"a tribune for open discussion of questions concerning religious and cultural problems,\" serving to promote \"neo-Christianity, social organization and whatever serves perfecting the human nature.\" Having lost by this time contacts with both Mir Iskusstva and Mir Bozhy, Merezhkovskys felt it was time for them to create their own magazine, as a means for \"bringing the thinking religious community together.\" In July 1902, in association with Pyotr Pertsov and assisted by some senior officials including ministers Dmitry Sipyagin and Vyacheslav von Plehve, they opened their own Novy Put (New Path) magazine, designed as an outlet for The Meetings.\nAfter the 22nd session, in April 1903, the Meetings of the group (by this time known as Bogoiskateli, or God-seekers) were cancelled by the procurator of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Konstantin Pobedonostsev's decree, the main reason being Merezhkovsky's frequent visits to places of mass sectarian settlements where God-seekers' radical ideas of Church 'renovation' were becoming popular. In Novy Put things changed too: with the arrival of strong personalities like Nikolai Berdyayev, Sergey Bulgakov and Semyon Frank the magazine solidified its position, yet drifted away from its originally declared mission. In the late 1904 Merezhkovsky and Gippius quit Novy Put, remaining on friendly terms with its new leaders and their now highly influential 'philosophy section'. In 1907 the Meetings revived under the new moniker of The Religious-Philosophical Society, Merezhkovsky once again promoting his 'Holy Ghost's Kingdom Come' ideas. This time it looked more like a literary circle than anything it had ever purported to be.The couple formed their own domestic \"church\", trying to involve miriskusniks. Of the latter, only Filosofov took the idea seriously and became the third member of the so-called Troyebratstvo (The Brotherhood of Three) built loosely upon the Holy Trinity format and having to do with the obscure 12th century idea of the Third Testament. Merezhkovsky developed it into the Church of the Holy Ghost, destined to succeed older churches \u2013 first of the Father (Old Testament), then of the Son (New Testament). The services at Troyebratstvo (with the traditional Russian Orthodox elements organized into a bizarre set of rituals) were seen by many as blasphemy and divided the St. Petersburg intellectual elite: Vasily Rozanov was fascinated by the thinly veiled eroticism of the happening, Nikolai Berdyaev was among those outraged by the whole thing, as were the (gay, mostly) members of Mir Iskusstva. Sergei Diaghilev accused Filosofov of committing 'adultery'. The latter in 1905 settled down in Merezhkovskys' St. Petersburg house, becoming virtually a family member.In 1904 Peter and Alexis, the third and final novel of Christ and Antichrist trilogy was published (in Novy Put, Nos.1\u20135, 9\u201312), having at its focus the figure of Peter the Great as an \"embodied Antichrist\" \u2013 an idea the author shared with Russian raskolniki. The novel's release was now eagerly anticipated in Europe where Merezhkovsky by this time has become a best-selling author, Julian the Apostate having undergone ten editions (in four years) in France. But when The Daily Telegraph described the novelist as \"an heir to Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky's legacy,\" back in Russia critics denounced this praise so unanimously that Merezhkovsky was forced to publicly deny having had any pretensions of this kind whatsoever.\n1905\u20131908\nAfter the Bloody Sunday of January 9, 1905, Merezhkovsky's views changed drastically, the defeat of the Imperial Russian Navy by the Imperial Japanese Navy helping him see, as he put it, \"the anti-Christian nature of the Russian monarchy.\" The 1905 Revolution was now seen by Merezhkovsky as a prelude for some kind of a religious upheaval he thought himself to be a prophet of. The writer became an ardent supporter of the civil unrest, writing pro-revolutionary verse, organizing protest parties for students, like that in Alexandrinsky theatre. In October 1905 he greeted the government's 'freedoms-granting' decree but since then was only strengthening ties with leftist radicals, notably, esers.\nIn The Forthcoming Ham  (Gryadushchu Ham, 1905) Merezhkovsky explained his political stance, seeing, as usual, all things refracted into Trinities. Using the pun (\"Ham\" in Russian, along with a Biblical character's name, meaning 'lout', 'boor') the author described the three \"faces of Ham'stvo\" (son of Noah's new incarnation as kind of nasty, God-jeering scoundrel Russian): the past (Russian Orthodox Church's hypocrisy), the present (the state bureaucracy and monarchy) and the future \u2013 massive \"boorish upstart rising up from society's bottom.\" Several years on the book was regarded as prophetic by many.In spring 1906, Merezhkovsky and Filosofov went into a self-imposed European exile in order to promote what they termed \"the new religious consciousness.\" In France they founded Anarchy and Theocracy magazine and released a compilation of essays called Le Tsar et la Revolution. In one of the articles he contributed to it, Revolution and Religion, Merezhkovsky wrote: \"Now it's almost impossible to foresee what a deadly force this revolutionary tornado starting upwards from the society's bottom will turn out to be. The church will be crashed down and the monarchy too, but with them \u2014 what if Russia itself is to perish \u2014 if not the timeless soul of it, then its body, the state?\" Again, what at the time was looked upon as dull political grotesque a decade later turned into grim reality.In 1908 the play about \"the routinous side of the revolution,\" Poppy Blossom (Makov Tzvet) came out, all three Troyebratstvo members credited as co-authors. It was followed by \"The Last Saint\" (Posledny Svyatoy), a study on Seraphim Sarovsky, this time Merezhkovsky's own work. More significant were two of his socio-political\/philosophical essays, \"Not Peace But Sword\" and \"In Sill Waters\". In them, working upon his concept of \"the evolutionary mysticism,\" Merezhkovsky argued that revolution in both Russia and the rest of the world (he saw the two as closely linked: the first \"steaming forward,\" the latter \"rattling behind\") was inevitable, but could succeed only if preceded by \"the revolution of the human spirit,\" involving the Russian intelligentsia's embracing his idea of the Third Testament. Otherwise, Merezhkovsky prophesied, political revolution will bring nothing but tyranny and the \"Kingdom of Ham.\"Among people whom Merezhkovskys talked with in Paris were Anatole France, Rudolf Steiner, Bergson, leaders of the French Socialists. Disappointed by the general polite indifference to their ideas, husband and wife returned home in the late 1908, but not before Merezhkovsky's historical drama Pavel the First (Pavel Pervy) was published. Confiscated and then banned by the Russian authorities, it became the first part of the trilogy The Kingdom of the Beast (Tsarstvo zverya). Dealing with the nature and history of the Russian monarchy, the trilogy had little in common with the author's earlier symbolism-influenced prose and, cast in the humanist tradition of the 19th-century Russian literature, was seen later as marking the peak of Merezhkovsky's literary career. The second and the third parts of the trilogy, the Decembrists novels Alexander the First and December 14 came out in 1913 and 1918 respectively.\n1909\u20131913\nIn 1909 Merezhkovsky found himself in the center of another controversy after coming out with harsh criticism of Vekhi, the volume of political and philosophical essays written and compiled by the group of influential writers, mostly his former friends and allies, who promoted their work as a manifesto, aiming to incite the inert Russian intelligentsia into the spiritual revival. Arguing against vekhovtsy's idea of bringing Orthodoxy and the Russian intellectual elite together, Merezhkovsky wrote in an open letter to Nikolay Berdyaev:Orthodoxy is the very soul of the Russian monarchy, and monarchy is the Orthodoxy's carcass. Among things they both hold sacred are political repressions, the [ultra-nationalist] Union of Russian People, the death penalty and meddling with other countries' international affairs. How can one entrust oneself to prayers of those whose actions one sees as God-less and demonic?\nSome argued Merezhkovsky's stance was inconsistent with his own ideas of some five years ago. After all, the Vekhi authors were trying to revitalize his own failed project of bringing the intellectual and the religious elites into collaboration. But the times have changed for Merezhkovsky and \u2013 following this (some argued, unacceptably scornful) anti-Vekhi tirade, his social status, too. Shunned by both former allies and the conservatives, he was hated by the Church: Saratov Bishop Dolganov even demanded his excommunication after the book Sick Russia  was published in 1910. For the Social Democrats, conversely, Merezhkovsky, not a \"decadent pariah\" any-more, suddenly turned a \"well-established Russian novelist\" and the \"pride of the European literature.\" Time has come for former friend Rozanov to write words that proved in the long run to be prophetic: \"The thing is, Dmitry Sergeyevich, those whom you are with now, will never be with you. Never will you find it in yourself to wholly embrace this dumb, dull and horrible snout of the Russian revolution.\"In the early 1910s Merezhkovsky moved to the left side of the Russian cultural spectrum, finding among his closest associates the esers Ilya Fondaminsky and, notably, Boris Savinkov. The latter was trying to receive from Merezhkovsky some religious and philosophical justification for his own terrorist ideology, but also had another, more down to Earth axe to grind, that of getting his first novel published. This he did, with Merezhkovsky's assistance \u2013 to strike the most unusual debut of the 1910 Russian literary season. In 1911 Merezhkovsky was officially accused of having links with terrorists. Pending trial (which included the case of Pavel Pervy play) the writer stayed in Europe, then crossed the border in 1912 only to have several chapters of Alexander the First novel confiscated. He avoided being arrested and in September, along with Pirozhkov, the publisher, was acquitted.1913 saw Merezhkovsky involved in another public scandal, when Vasily Rozanov openly accused him of having ties with the \"terrorist underground\" and, as he put it, \"trying to sell Motherland to Jews.\" Merezhkovsky suggested that the Religious and Philosophical Society should hold a trial and expel Rozanov from its ranks. The move turned to be miscalculated, the writer failing to take into account the extent of his own unpopularity within the Society. The majority of the latter declined the proposal. Rozanov, high-horsed, quit the Society on his own accord to respond stingingly by publishing Merezhkovsky's private letters so as to demonstrate the latter's hypocrisy on the matter.\n1914\u20131919\nFor a while 1914 looked as though it was going to be the first ever relatively calm year for Merezhkovsky. With the two Complete Works Of editions released by the Wolfe's and Sytin's publishing houses, academic Nestor Kotlyarevsky nominated the author for the Nobel Prize for literature. Then World War I broke out. THe Merezhkovskys expressed their skepticism as to the Russian involvement in it and the patriotic hullabaloo stirred up by some intellectuals. The writer made a conscious effort to distance himself from politics and succeeded almost, but in 1915 was in it again, becoming friends with Alexander Kerensky and joining the Maxim Gorky-led Movement of the patriotic left calling for Russia's withdrawal from the War in the most painless possible way.A couple of new plays by Merezhkovsky, Joy Will Come (Radost Budet) and The Romantics were staged in war-time Petrograd theaters. The latter was successful, hit, but for the mainstream critics its author remained a \"controversial author.\" \"All in all, Russian literature is as hostile to me as it has always been. I could as well be celebrating the 25th anniversary of this hostility,\" the author wrote in his short autobiography for Semyon Vengerov's biographical dictionary.\n1917: February and October\n1917 for Merezhkovskys started with a bout of political activity: the couple's flat on Sergiyevskaya Street looked like a secret branch of Russian Duma (that was when the seeds of a rumour concerning the couple's alleged membership in the Russian freemason community were sown). Merezhkovsky greeted the February anti-monarchy revolution and described the Kerensky-led Provisional government as \"quite friendly.\" By the end of the spring he had become disillusioned with the government and its ineffective leader; in summer he began to speak of the government's inevitable fall and the Bolshevik's tyranny coming. The late October saw Merezhkovsky's worst expectations coming to life.For Merezhkovsky the October Socialist revolution was a catastrophe. He saw it as the Coming of Ham he wrote about a decade later, the tragic victory for, as he choose to put it, Narod-Zver (The Beast-nation), the political and social incarnation of the universal Evil, putting the whole human civilization to danger. Merezhkovsky and Gippius tried to use whatever influence they retained upon the Bolshevist cultural leaders to ensure the release of their friends, the arrested Provisional government ministers. Ironically, one of the first thing the Soviet government did was lift the ban from the anti-monarchist Pavel Pervy play and it was staged in several of Red Russia's theaters.\nFor a while Merezhkovskys's flat served as an esers' headquarters but this came to an end in January 1918 when the so-called Uchredilovka was dissolved by Vladimir Lenin. In his 1918 diary Merezhkovsky wrote:How fragrantly fresh our February and March were, with their bluish, heavenly blizzards, what a beauty human face shone with! Where is it all now? Peering into the October crowd, one sees that it is faceless. Not the ugliness of it, but facelessness is what's most disgusting. [...] Strolling down the Petersburg streets, I recognize a Communist face at once. What frightens most in it \u2013 the self-satisfaction of a satiated beast, animalistic obtuseness? No, the most horrible in this face is its dreariness, this transcendental dreariness, found only in Paradise that's been found on Earth, the Antichrist's Kingdom Come.\nIn 1919, having sold everything including dishes and extra clothes,  Merezhkovskys started collaborating with Maxim Gorky's new World Literature publishing house, receiving salary and food rations. \"Russian Communists are not all of them villains. There are well-meaning, honest, crystal clear people among them. Saints, almost. These are the most horrible ones. These saints stink of the 'Chinese meat' most,\" Merezhkovsky wrote in his diary.After news started to filter through of Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin's consequent defeats, Merezhkovskys saw their only chance of survival in fleeing Russia. This they did on December 14, 1919, along with Filosofov and Zlobin (Gippius' young secretary), having obtained Anatoly Lunacharsky-signed permission \"to leave Petrograd for the purpose of reading some lectures on Ancient Egypt to Red Army fighters.\"\nMerezhkovsky in exile\nMerezkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov and Zlobin headed first for Minsk, then Vilno, staying in both cities to give newspaper interviews and public lectures. Speaking to a Vilno correspondent, Merezhkovsky commented:The whole question of Russia's existence as such \u2014 and it's non-existent at the moment, as far as I am concerned, \u2014 depends on Europe's recognizing at last the true nature of Bolshevism. Europe has to open its eyes to the fact that Bolshevism uses the Socialist banner only as a camouflage; that what it does in effect is defile high Socialist ideals; that it is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. ...There is not a trace in Russia at the moment of either Socialism or even the [proclaimed] dictatorship of proletariat; the only dictatorship that's there is that of the two people: Lenin and Trotsky.\nIn Warsaw Merezhkovsky did practical work for some Russian immigrant organizations, Gippius edited the literary section in Svoboda newspaper. Both were regarding Poland as a \"messianic\", potentially unifying place and a crucial barrier in the face of the spreading Bolshevist plague. In the summer of 1920 Boris Savinkov arrived into the country to have talks with J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski: he engaged Merezhkovsky and Filosofov in the activities of the so-called Russian Evacuation committee (more of a White Army mobilization center) and introduced the writer to Pi\u0142sudski. On behalf of the Committee Merezhkovsky issued a memorandum calling the peoples of Russia to stop fighting the Polish army and join its ranks. The whole thing flopped, though, as Poland and Russia reached the armistice agreement. Merezhkovskys and Zlobin left for France, Filosofov staying in Warsaw to head the Savinkov-led Russian National committee's anti-Bolshevik propaganda department.In Paris Merezhkovsky founded the Religious Union (later Soyuz Neprimirimykh, the Union of the Unpacified), was holding lectures, contributed to Pavel Milyukov's Poslednye Novosty and Pyotr Struve's Osvobozhdenye newspapers, exposing what he saw as the Bolshevist lies and denouncing the \"Kingdom of Antichrist.\" It was becoming more and more obvious, though, that Merezhkovsky, backed only by the circle of friends, was in isolation, misunderstood by some, abhorred by others. His calling for the international intervention into Russia angered the left; rejecting the restoration of the Russian monarchy antagonized the right. His single ally at the time was Ivan Bunin; never sharing much personal affinity, the two men formed an alliance in their relentless anti-Soviet campaign. Besides, having maintained strong contacts with influential French politics lobbying the interests of the Russian immigrants, both ensured that the Russian writers should get some financial support from the French government. A couple of years later another sponsor was found in Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk who granted personal pensions to some prominent figures in the immigrant Russian writers' community.Merezhkovsky insisted upon severing all the International PEN's contacts with Communist Russia and cancelling French help for the victims of mass hunger in Russian Volga Region arguing, not unreasonably, that those in need will not ever see any of the money or food sent. He criticised the exiled Russian Constituent Assembly's communique which was, in his opinion, too conciliatory in tone. In 1922 the collection of articles and essays of the four authors (Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov contacts with whom have been restored, and Zlobin) came out under the title The Kingdom of Antichrist, the general idea of the book being that the 'Russian fires', globalist in their nature and intent, promise \"either brotherhood in slavery or the end in a common grave\" for the European nations.In winter 1925 a small literary and philosophy circle was formed by Merezhkovsky and Gippius; two years later it was officially launched as the Green Lamp group. With the Novy Korabl (The New Ship) magazine of its own, the group attracted the whole of the Russian intellectual elite in exile and remained the important cultural center for the next ten years. \"We are the Criticism of Russia as such, the latter's disembodied Thought and Conscience, free to judge its present and foresee its future,\" wrote Merezhkovsky of the Green Lamp mission.In 1928 at the First Congress of Russian writers in exile held in Belgrade, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia bestowed on Merezhkovsky the Order of Savva of the 1st Degree merited by his services for world culture. A series of lectures organised for Merezhkovsky and Gippius by the Serbian Academy signalled the launch of the Yugoslav-based \"Russian Library\" series, where the best works of Bunin, Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Alexander Kuprin, Aleksey Remizov, Konstantin Balmont, Ivan Shmelyov and Igor Severyanin came out over the next several years. Things started to deteriorate in the early 1930s; with the Czech and the French grants withdrawn and much feared Socialists rising high on the French political scene, Merezhkovskys looked southwards and found there a sympathizer in Benito Mussolini who took great interest in the work and views of a Russian writer, now a multiple Nobel Prize for literature nominee.\nMerezhkovsky's literary activities: 1925\u20131941\nIn the mid-1920s, disappointed by the Western cultural elite's reaction to his political manifestos, Merezhkovsky returned to religious and philosophical essays, but in the new format, that of a monumental free-form experimental-styled treatise. Some of his new books were biographies, some just extensive, amorphous researches in ancient history. Speaking of the first two of them, The Birth of Gods. Tutankhamen in Crete (1925) and Messiah (1928), Merezhkovsky thus explained his credo: \"Many people think I am a historical novelist, which is wrong. What I use the Past for is only searching for the Future. The Present is a kind of exile to me. My true home is the Past\/Future, which is where I belong.\"Of the three fundamental books Merezhkovsky created in the late 1920s early 1930s another trilogy took shape, loosely linked by the concept of man's possible way to salvation. The Mystery of the Three: Egypt and Babylon (Prague, 1925) was followed by the Mystery of the West: Atlantis-Europe (Berlin, 1930), where the cherished Third Testament idea took an apocalyptic, Nietzschean turn. The third, Unfamiliar Jesus (1932, Belgrade), is seen in retrospect as the strongest of the three.All of a sudden Merezhkovsky, a prolific writer again, drifted into the focus of the Nobel Prize committee attention. From 1930 onwards Sigurd Agrell, professor of Slavic languages in Lund University, started to methodically nominate Merezhkovsky for the Prize, although, invariably (and rather frustratingly for both), in tandem with Ivan Bunin. In November 1932 Gippius in a letter to Vera Bunina expressed her opinion that Merezhkovsky had no chance of winning \"because of his anti-Communist stance,\" but the truth was, Bunin (no lesser a Communism-loather than his rival) wrote books that were more accessible and, generally, popular. Merezkovsky even suggested they should make a pact and divide the money should one of them ever win, but Bunin took seriously what was meant apparently as a joke and responded with outright refusal. He won the Prize in 1933.Agrell continued nominating Merezhkovsky up until his own death in 1937 (making eight such nominations, in all), but each year the latter's chances were getting slimmer. The books he produced in his latter years (like the compilation of religious biographies Faces of Saints: from Jesus to Nowadays and The Reformers trilogy, published posthumously) were not ground-breaking. Hard times and deepening troubles notwithstanding, Merezhkovsky continued to work hard until his dying day, trying desperately to complete his Spanish Mysteries trilogy; the last of the three pieces, the unfinished Little Theresa, was with him at his deathbed; he died literally with a pen in his hand.\nMerezhkovsky and the European dictators\nAlthough never a Russian nationalist, Merezhkovsky was a Russo-centric author and thinker, cherishing the idea of his country's unique and in many ways decisive place in the world culture in history. Never tiring of reiterating the \"Russian plight is the problem of the world, not Russia\" postulate, he was ever on the look-out for some \"strong leader\" who would be able to organize and successfully see through the anti-Communist crusade. For a while Merezhkovsky thought he had found his hero in Benito Mussolini who, having sponsored his book on Dante, had several lengthy talks with the Russian writer on politics, literature and art. Impressed, Merezhkovsky started to see his new friend almost as an incarnation of Dante. In a letter addressed to Mussolini, he wrote:The best, the truest and the liveliest document on Dante is \u2014 your personality. To understand Dante one has to live through him, but only you being around makes that possible. Two souls, his and yours, are merged into one, Infinity itself bringing you two together. Visualize Mussolini in contemplation, and it's Dante. Imagine Dante in action, and it's Mussolini.\nAll the while Merezhkovsky was trying to convince Mussolini that it was the latter's mission to start the \"Holy War against Russia\" (the idea formed the basis of his article \"Meeting Mussolini\", published by Illustrated Russia in February 1937). Seeing his name frequently mentioned by the Italian press in connection with Merezhkovsky's bizarre suggestions made the Duce uneasy and he took a step back. Visiting Rome in summer 1937, Merezhkovsky had talks with the Italian Foreign Minister, but failed to meet Mussolini. Then came the disillusionment, and in October of the same year he was already speaking of how disappointed he was with the Italian leader's \"petty materialism\". He tried to contact General Francisco Franco, now seeing Spain as the last anti-Communist citadel of Europe - and failed. Thus Merezhkovsky's choice of the new European \"heroes\" narrowed down to Adolf Hitler.Merezhkovsky had never seen Fascism as an alternative to Communism. As early as 1930 he wrote of a doomed Europe stuck between the two \"stores of explosives: Fascism and Communism\", expressing hope that some day these two evils will somehow destroy one another. But the danger of the Fuhrer's possible subjugation of Europe was still the lesser evil for him - compared to possible Communist expansion. The \"Hitler dilemma\" was the only thing husband and wife ever disagreed on. Gippius hated and despised the Fuhrer, referring to him as \"an idiot\". Merezhkovsky thought he found a leader who'd be able to take the whole of Antichrist Kingdom upon himself, this outweighing for him such trivia as the fact that his own Joan of Arc (1939) was banned in Germany on the day of its release.In summer 1939 Paramount (in collaboration with the French Association des Auteurs de Films) bought Merezhkovsky's scenario The Life of Dante. The production was cancelled on September 1, as World War II broke out in Europe. On September 9, fleeing the air raids, the Merezhkovskys moved to  Biarritz in the south of France, where they spent the next three months, communicating mainly with the French and the English military officers, but also with Irina Odoyevtseva and her husband Georgy Ivanov.On June 27, 1940 the German Wehrmacht occupied Biarritz. Here in a hotel on August 14 the writer's 75th anniversary celebration was held, organized by a group of French writers, with some notable Russians like Pavel Milyukov, Ivan Bunin and Mark Aldanov invited. It was there that Merezhkovsky made comments which (according to biographer Yuri Zobnin) were later presented by some memoirists as his \"infamous German radio speech\". Still, even Zobnin admits that there were reasons to regard Merezhkovsky as a Nazi sympathizer. In the autumn of 1941 Merezhkovsky found himself in the center of his German admirers \u2013 students, mostly, but army officers too. It was their German friends who helped the couple move back to Paris from Biarritz where they found themselves penniless and on the verge of homelessness. \"Merezhkovsky flew up to the Nurnberg fires with the agitation of a newly born butterfly... By this time most of us stopped visiting them,\" wrote Vasily Janowski, a Green Lamp group member.\nThe \"infamous radio speech\"\nExactly how and why did Merezhkovsky found himself on the German radio in June 1941 nobody was quite sure of. Gippius (according to Yury Terapiano who was quoting Nina Berberova)  blamed her own secretary Vladimir Zlobin who, using his German connections, allegedly persuaded the elderly man to come to the studio in the early days of the Nazi invasion of the USSR. In his speech (if its printed version entitled \"Bolshevism and Humanity\" is to be believed) Merezhkovsky, comparing Hitler to Joan of Arc, called for an anti-Bolshevik crusade, reiterating, among other things, what he was saying all through the 1920s and 1930s:Bolshevism will never change its nature... because right from the start it's been not a national, but international phenomenon. From the very first day Russia has been \u2013 and remains to this very day \u2013 only a means to the end: that of its conquering the whole world.\n\"This is the end for us,\" Gippius allegedly commented, disgusted and horrified. In the days to come, though, husband and wife (as those who knew them later attested) often expressed horror at the news of Nazis' atrocities on the Eastern front; according to Gippius' friend, poet Victor Mamchenko, Merezhkovsky far from supporting Hitler, in those days was actually condemning him.Biographer Zobnin doubts that Merezhkovsky appeared on German radio at all, noting that none of the memoirists who mentioned it had himself heard Merezhkovsky speaking on air. All of those \"witnesses\" invariably referred to the printed version of the \"speech\" published in 1944 by Parizhsky Vestnik. This document, according to Zobnin (the author of the first  comprehensive Merezhkovsky biography published in Russia) was most certainly a montage fake, concocted by Nazi propagandists out of the 1939 unpublished essay The Mystery of the Russian Revolution (on Dostoyevsky's Demons novel), with bits and pieces thrown in. The researcher insists such a speech could not have been broadcast in the late June: the couple resided in Biarritz and for an elderly person to give everybody a slip and somehow get to Paris was hardly probable.\nAdding to the confusion is the well-documented fact that Merezhkovsky had already made one speech mentioning Hitler and Joan of Arc in one breath. It happened in August 1940 at his 75th-birthday celebration in Biarritz, and in a different context. In fact, his speech caused trouble because it was deemed too pro-Russian and anti-German. According to Teffi, one of the people present, \u2014 On the huge hotel terrace under the guidance of countess G., the audience gathered, German uniform seen here and there. Merezhkovsky pronounced a lengthy tirade which rather frightened the Russian camp. Targeting both bolsheviks and the [German] fascists, he spoke of the times when the nightmare finally ends, both Antichrists \u2013 one tormenting Russia, the other tormenting France \u2013 perish, and the 'Russia of Dostoyevsky' at last will be able to stretch a hand to the 'France of Pascal and Joan of Arc'. \"Well, now they'll throw us out of the hotel, that's for sure,\" horrified Russian lodgers were whispering. But the Germans looked as if they never heard this prophecy: they applauded benevolently, along with others.\nIrina Odoyevtseva independently corroborated this. \"He was going on about the Atlantis and its demise. For those who understood Russian it was obvious that what he meant was Germany's defeat and Russia's imminent victory, but the Germans never understood this and applauded,\" she remembered. All this, according to Zobnin, makes the \"infamous German radio speech\" look very much like a Nazi propaganda myth, picked up first by Yuri Terapiano, then authenticated by numerous reiterations.\nMerezhkovsky's death\nFor the last three months of his life Merezhkovsky was working continuously in the couple's Paris flat, trying to finish Little Theresa. On December 6 husband and wife returned from one of their regular walks and spent the evening, in Gippius' words, \"arguing, as usual, about the Russia versus freedom dilemma.\" Skipping both supper and his habitual evening cigarette, Merezhkovsky went to his room early. Next morning the maid called Gippius to tell her the man was in some kind of trouble. Merezhkovsky was sitting unconscious next to a cold fireplace. The doctor arrived in 15 minutes' time and diagnosed brain hemorrhage. In half an hour Merezhkovsky was pronounced dead. \"...Me, I'm a worm, not man, slandered by humans, despised by peoples (Ps. 21, 7). But wrap itself into a chrysalis a hapless worm does only to break out as a shiny white, sunlight-like, resurrected butterfly,\" these were his last written words found on a piece of paper on a table. The funeral service was held on December 10 in the Orthodox church of Saint Aleksandr Nevsky. Dmitry Merezhkovsky was buried at the Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery, with just several people attending the ceremony.\nMerezhkovsky's ideas\nMerezhkovsky's first adopted philosophical trend was the then popular positivism. Soon, disillusioned in this idea, although never rejecting it wholly, Merezhkovsky turned to religion. Seeds of this hybrid (European positivism grafted to what's been described as \"the subjective idealism\" of Russian Orthodoxy) sown on the field of literature study brought forth a brochure entitled \"On the Causes of the Decline and the New Trends in Contemporary Russian Literature\". This manifesto gave a burgeoning Russian Symbolist movement both ideology and the name as such: Merezhkovsky was the first in Russia to speak of symbols as definitive means of cognizance in modern Art.\nIn the center of this new train of thought was the notion of \"rejecting the rational in favour of the intuitive\" by means of exploiting what the author termed as \"spirituality of a symbol,\" seeing the latter as a perfect means of describing Reality, otherwise unfathomable. Only through a symbol, according to Merezhkovsky, one could get to an object's deeper meaning, whereas (quoting, as he did, Tyutchev) \"thought, whilst being spoken, turns a lie\": In poetry the unspoken things, flickering through the beauty of symbol, affect us stronger than what's expressed by words. Symbolism endows both style and essence of poetry with spirituality; poetic word becomes clear and translucent as walls of alabaster amphora carrying flame... Longing for things that have never been experienced yet, looking for undertones yet unknown, searching out dark and unconscious things in our sensual world is the coming Ideal poetry's main characteristics. [...] The three principal elements of the new art are: the mystic essence, symbolism and the expansion of artist's impressiveness. \u2013 Dmitry Merezhkovsky.\nAccording to scholar D.Churakov, Merezhkovsky, pronouncing \"the death of metaphysics\" and putting forward the idea that only language of symbols could be an adequate instrument for discovering the modern world's pattern of meanings, was unwillingly following Auguste Comte, the difference being that the latter was employing these ideas in scientific fields, while the former proposed to use them in literature and criticism.\nThe Third Testament\nMerezhkovsky's next and most fundamental step ahead as a self-styled modernist philosophy leader was taken in tandem with his young intellectual wife Zinaida Gippius who from the first days of their meeting started generating new ideas for her husband to develop. Thus the Third Testament theory was born, or rather revived, transplanted from its Middle Ages Italian origins into the early 20th century's Russian ambience. It was the Third Testament that formed the basis of the early 20th-century Russian New Religious Consciousness movement which in turn kick started the Religious-Philosophical Society into action, again Gippius producing basic ideas for her husband to formulate. Borrowing the original idea from Joachim of Fiore, a 12th-century theologist, Merezhkovskys created and developed their own concept of man's full-circle religious evolution. In it the Bible was seen as a starting point with God having taken two steps towards Man, for the latter to respond with the third, logically conclusive one.According to Merezhkovsky, the First (Divine Father's) and the Second (Divine Son's) Testaments could be seen only as preliminary steps towards the Third one, that of the Holy Ghost. With the first maintaining the Law of God and the second \u2013 the Grace of God, what the third Testament should do is bring Liberation to the human race; the First Testament revealing God's power as the gospel Truth, the Second transforming the gospel Truth into Love, the Third translating Love into Liberation. In this last Kingdom \"pronounced and heard will be \u2013 the final, never before revealed name of the coming one: God the Liberator,\" according to the author.Merezhkovsky saw the Third Testament as a synthesis of the two original revelations: that \"about Earth\" (pre-Christian beliefs) and that \"about Heaven\" (Christianity). The Mystery of the Holy Trinity, when resolved, should link three elements into a circle, the great \"new Earth under the new Heavens,\" as promised in the Book of the Apocalypse. As Rozanov put it, \"Merezhkovsky's greatest innovation was this attempt to merge together the two \u2014 the Christian and the Heathen \u2014 poles of poignancy. To discover a 'tempting vice' in the greatest of virtues and the greatest of virtues in the tempting vice.\" This New Trinity concept implied that the all-inviting Holy Ghost was not a sexless spirit, but a female entity.\nSex and spirituality\nHuman history, according to Merezhkovsky, was one ceaseless \"battle of two abysses\": the abyss of Flesh (as discovered by pre-Christians) and the abyss of Spirit (opened by Christianity's sexless asceticism). Pre-Christians celebrated flesh-driven sensuality at the expense of spirituality. Ascetic Christians brought about the rise of Spirit, at the expense of sex. Merezhkovsky declared the dialectical inevitability of thesis and antithesis' coming together, of the spiritual and the sexual poles uniting on a higher, celestial level.In his own words, \"Being aware of myself in my body, I'm at the root of personality. Being aware of myself in the other one's body, I'm at the root of sex. Being aware of myself in all human bodies, I am at the root of unity\". Noticing that one of the Aramaic languages translates Spirit as Rucha, a female entity, Merezhkovsky interpreted the Holy Trinity as Father and Son's unity in the higher being, their common godly Mother. It is the latter's Kingdom Come that the Third Testament was supposed to lead to. Seeing both God and man as intrinsically unisexual, Merezhkovsky regarded a male\/female schism to be a symptom of imperfection, the cause for primal human being's fatal disintegration.In the modern times, according to Merezhkovsky, both monastic and ascetic Christianity will cease to exist. Art would not just adopt religious forms, but become an integral part of religion, the latter taken in broader concept. Human evolution as he saw it, would lead to merging of whatever had been polarized: sex and spirit, religion and culture, male and female, et cetera \u2014 bringing about Kingdom Come, not 'out there', but 'here on Earth'.\nMerezhkovsky and \"religious anarchism\"\nMan's evolutional progress towards the Third Testament Kingdom Come will not be without some revolutionary upheavals, according to Merezhkovsky, will be strewn with \"catastrophes\", most of them dealing with the \"revolution of Spirit.\" The consequence of such revolution would bring about gradual change in the nature of religion itself, the latter taking under its spacious wing not only man's sensual liberation but also the latter's \"freedom of rebellion.\" \"We are human only as long as we're rebels,\" Merezhkovsky insisted, expressing what some saw as a proto-existentialist idea.One result of the \"revolution of Spirit\" should be the severing of ties between state and religion, according to Merezhkovsky. \"The Church \u2013 not the old, but the new, eternal, universal one \u2013 is as opposite to the idea of the state as an absolute truth is opposing an absolute lie,\" he declared in an open letter to Berdyaev.B.Rozental, analyzing Merezhkovsky's political and religious philosophy, thus summed up the writer's position: \"The Law amounts to violence... The difference between legitimate power that holds violence 'in reserve' and violence itself is but a matter of degree: sinful are both. Autocracy and murder are nothing more than the two extreme forms of exhibiting [criminal] power.\" Interpreting the Biblical version of the human history as a sequence of revolutionary events, Merezhkovsky saw religion and revolution as inseparable. It is just that for a social revolution to succeed, spiritual revolution should always come one step ahead of it. In Russia the lack of the latter brought about the former's fiasco, with Antichrist taking hold of things, he argued.In the 1920s Merezhkovsky lost interest in the religious anarchism doctrine. In his later years he became close to ecumenical ideals, prophesying the Kingdom Come as a synthesis of \"Peter, Paul and John's principles\", that is, bringing Catholic, Protestant and Eastern Orthodox traditions together.\nLegacy\nThroughout his lifetime Dmitry Merezhkovsky polarized opinion in his native Russia, bringing upon himself both praise and scorn, occasionally from the same quarters. According to Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Merezhkovsky became Russia's first ever \"new-type, universal kind of a dissident who managed to upset just about everybody who thought themselves to be responsible for guarding morality and order\":Tsarist government saw Merezhkovsky as subverting the state foundations, patriarchs of official Orthodoxy regarded him a heretic, for literary academia he was a decadent, for Futurists \u2013 a retrograde, for Lev Trotsky, this ardent global revolution ideologist, \u2013 a reactionary. Sympathetic Anton Chekhov's words came and went unnoticed: 'A believer he is, a believer of an apostolic kind'.\nIn the words of a modern biographer, \"he will find his place in history alongside Marquis de Sade, Nietzsche and Henry Miller, those classics who only through being condemned and ostracized by the many could be approached and appreciated by the few.\" \"I was disliked and scolded in Russia, loved and praised abroad, but misunderstood, both here and there,\" Merezhkovsky wrote in a letter to Nikolai Berdyaev.Merezhkovsky has been given credit for his exceptional erudition, the scientific approach to writing, literary gift and stylistic originality. Seen in retrospect as the first ever (and, arguably, the only one) Russian \"cabinet writer of a European type,\" Merezhkovsky was, according to Berdyayev, \"one of the best-educated people in Saint Petersburg of the first quarter of the 20th century.\" Korney Chukovsky, pondering on the dire state of the early 20th century Russia's cultural elite, admitted that \"the most cultured of them all\" was this \"mysterious, unfathomable, almost mythical creature, Merezhkovsky\". Anton Chekov insisted that the Russian Academy of Sciences should appoint Merezhkovsky its honorary academic, in as early as 1902.Merezhkovsky was the first in Russia to formulate the basic principles of Symbolism and Modernism, as opposed to 'decadence', a tag he was battling with. Never aspiring to a leading role in the movement, he soon became, according to I. Koretskaya, \"a kind of handy encyclopedia for the ideology of Symbolism,\" which others \"could borrow aesthetic, socio-historical and even moral ideas from.\" Having added a new (\"thought-driven\") dimension to the genre of historical novel and turning it into a modern art form, Merezhkovsky influenced Andrey Bely and Aleksey Remizov, as well as Valery Bryusov, Aleksey N. Tolstoy, Mikhail Bulgakov and Mark Aldanov. It was Merezhkovsky who introduced such concepts as a \"modernist novel\" and a \"symbolic historical novel\" to the conservative Russian literature scene of the late 1890s.Merezhkovsky was praised as an engaging essayist and \"a master of quote-juggling.\" Some critics loathed the repetitiveness in Merezhkovsky's prose, others admired his (in a broad sense) musical manner of employing certain ideas almost as symphonic themes, which was new at the time.No less influential, even if so much more controversial, were Merezhkovsky's philosophical, religious and political ideas. Alongside the obvious list of contemporary followers (Bely, Blok, etc.; almost all of them later became detractors) deeply interested in his theories were political figures (Fondaminsky, Kerensky, Savinkov), psychologists (Freud), philosophers (Berdyaev, Rickert, Stepun), lawyers (Kowalewsky). Thomas Mann wrote of Merezhkovsky as of a \"genius critic and specialist in a world psychology, second only to Nietzsche.\" Notable other Germans influenced by Merezhkovsky included Arthur Moeller van den Bruck and Alfred RosenbergLater researchers noted Merezhkovsky's willingness to question dogmas and thwart tradition with disregard to public opinion, never shying controversy and even scandal. Crucial in this context (according to O.Dafier) was his \"quest for ways of overcoming deep crisis which came as a result of the Russian traditionalist Church losing its credibility.\"\nCriticism\nIn Russia the general response to Merezhkovsky's literary, cultural and social activities was negative. His prose, even if on the face of it stylistically flawless and occasionally accessible, was, critics argued, an elitist thing unto itself, \"hermetically closed for the uninitiated majority.\" \"Having isolated himself from the real life, Merezhkovsky built up the inner temple for his own personal use. Me-and-culture, me-and-Eternity \u2013 those were his recurring themes,\" wrote in 1911 Leon Trotsky.\nFor all his scientifically strict, academic approach to the process of collecting and re-processing material, contemporary academia, with little exception, ridiculed Merezhkovsky, dismissing him as a gifted charlatan, bent on rewriting history in accordance with his own current ideological and philosophical whims. Due to his incorrigible, as many saw it, tendency towards inconsistency, Merezhkovsky's old allies were deserting him, while new ones approached him warily. Vasily Rozanov wrote in 1909: Merezhkovsky is a Thing that ceaselessly speaks; a jacket and trousers combination producing a torrent of noise...  To clear grounds for more speaking activity, once in three years he undergoes a total change of mental wardrobe and for the following three years busies himself in defying all things he was maintaining previously.\nAnother former friend, Minsky, questioned Merezhkovsky's credibility as a critic, finding in his biographies a tendency to see in his subjects only things that he wanted to see, skillfully \"re-moulding questions into instant answers.\"For all his religiosity, Merezhkovsky was never popular with either Russian Orthodox Church officials or the religious intellectual elite of the time, people like Sergey Bulgakov, Pavel Florensky and Lev Shestov fiercely denouncing his ideas and projects. Similarly, the reputation of a radical Social democrat hasn't made Merezhkovsky popular in the leftist literary camp. He was variously described as \"an anti-literature phenomenon\" (Viktor Shklovsky), \"the greatest corpse in the Russian literature\" (Ivanov-Razumnik) and \"a book-worm\", totally \"foreign to all things human\" (Korney Chukovsky).The writer's work published in emigration was, according to the 1934 Soviet Literary encyclopedia \"the telling example of the ideological degradation and cultural degeneration of the White emigres.\" Maxim Gorky's verdict: \"Dmitry Merezhkovsky, a well-known God-admirer of a Christian mode, is a small man whose literary activity is akin to that of a type-writer: each type is clear and well-read, but it's soul-less and boring,\" served as a leitmotif of the Soviet literary officialdom's view on Merezhkovsky for decades. In the Soviet times the writer was (in the words of Alexander Men) \"aggressively forgotten,\" his works unofficially banned up until the early 1990s, when the floodgate of re-issues opened the way for serious critical analysis of Merezhkovsky's life and legacy.\nSelect bibliography\nNovels\nChrist and Antichrist trilogyThe Death of the Gods.

He was a prolific writer: between the start of his career in 1898 and his death he completed 34 novels, seven volumes of short stories, 13 plays (some in collaboration with other writers), and a daily journal of more than a million words. He wrote articles and stories for more than 100 different newspapers and periodicals, worked in, and briefly ran, the Ministry of Information in the First World War, and wrote for the cinema in the 1920s.\nBorn into a modest but upwardly-mobile family in Hanley, in the Staffordshire Potteries, Bennett was intended by his father, a solicitor, to follow him into the law. Bennett worked for his father, before moving to another law firm in London as a clerk, aged 21. He became assistant editor and then editor of a women's magazine, before becoming a full-time author in 1900. Always a devotee of French culture in general and literature in particular, he moved to Paris in 1902, where the relaxed social milieu helped him overcome his intense shyness, particularly with women. He spent ten years in France, marrying a Frenchwoman in 1907. In 1912 he moved back to England. He and his wife separated in 1921 and he spent the last years of his life with a new partner, an English actress. He died in 1931 of typhoid fever having unwisely drunk tap water in France.\nBennett is best known for his novels and short stories, many of which are set in a fictionalised version of the Potteries, which he called The Five Towns. He strongly believed that literature should be accessible to ordinary people, and he deplored literary cliques and \u00e9lites. His books appealed to a wide public and sold in large numbers. For this reason writers and supporters of the modernist school belittled him, and much of his work became neglected after his death. Bennett was also a playwright; he did less well in the theatre than with novels, but achieved two considerable successes with Milestones (1912) and The Great Adventure (1913).\nStudies by Margaret Drabble (1974), John Carey (1992) and others have led to a re-evaluation of Bennett's work. His finest novels, including Anna of the Five Towns (1902), The Old Wives' Tale (1908), Clayhanger (1910) and Riceyman Steps (1923), are now widely recognised as major works.\n\nLife and career\nEarly years\nArnold Bennett was born on 27 May 1867, in Hanley, Staffordshire, now a constituent part of Stoke-on-Trent, but then an independent town. He was the eldest child of the three sons and three daughters of Enoch Bennett (1843\u20131902) and his wife Sarah Ann, n\u00e9e Longson (1840\u20131914). Enoch Bennett's early career had been one of mixed fortunes: after an unsuccessful attempt to run a business making and selling pottery, he set up as a draper and pawnbroker in 1866. Four years later his father died, leaving him some money, with which he articled himself to a local law firm; in 1876 he qualified as a solicitor. The Bennetts were staunch Wesleyans, musical, cultured and sociable. Enoch Bennett had an authoritarian side, but it was a happy household, although a mobile one: as Enoch's success as a solicitor increased, the family moved, within the space of five years, to four different houses in Hanley and the neighbouring Burslem.\nFrom 1877 to 1882 Bennett's schooling was at the Wedgwood Institute, Burslem, followed by a year at a grammar school in Newcastle-under-Lyme. He was good at Latin and better at French; he had an inspirational headmaster who gave him a love for French literature and the French language that lasted all his life. He did well academically and passed Cambridge University examinations that could have led to his becoming an undergraduate, but his father had other plans. In 1883, aged 16, Bennett left school and began work \u2013 unpaid \u2013 in his father's office. He divided his time between uncongenial jobs, such as rent collecting, during the day, and studying for examinations in the evening. He began writing in a modest way, contributing light pieces to the local newspaper. He became adept in Pitman's shorthand, a skill much sought after in commercial offices, and on the strength of that he secured a post as a clerk at a firm of solicitors in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. In 1891, aged 21, he left for London and never returned to live in his native county.\nFirst years in London\nIn the solicitors' office in London, Bennett became friendly with a young colleague, John Eland, who had a passion for books. Eland's friendship helped alleviate Bennett's innate shyness, which was exacerbated by a lifelong stammer. Together they explored the world of literature. Among the writers who impressed and influenced Bennett were George Moore, \u00c9mile Zola, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Guy de Maupassant, Gustave Flaubert and Ivan Turgenev. He continued his own writing, and won a prize of twenty guineas for a contribution to a magazine, and when Tit-Bits rejected a short story he submitted it successfully to The Yellow Book, where it featured alongside contributions from Henry James and other well-known writers.In 1894 Bennett resigned from the law firm and became assistant editor of the magazine Woman. The salary, \u00a3150 a year, was \u00a350 less than he was earning as a clerk, but the post left him much more free time to write his first novel. For the magazine he wrote under a range of female pen-names such as \"Gwendolen\" and \"Cecile\". As his biographer Margaret Drabble puts it:\n\nThe informal office life of the magazine suited Bennett, not least because it brought him into lively female company, and he began to be a little more relaxed with young women. He continued work on his novel and wrote short stories and articles. He was clear-eyed about his literary talent: he wrote to a friend, \"I have no inward assurance that I could ever do anything more than mediocre viewed strictly as art \u2013 very mediocre\" but he knew he could \"turn out things which would be read with zest, & about which the man in the street would say to friends 'Have you read so & so in the What-is-it?'\" He was happy to write for popular journals like Hearth and Home or for the highbrow The Academy.His debut novel, The Man from the North, completed in 1896 was published two years later. It elicited a letter of praise from Joseph Conrad and was well and widely reviewed, but Bennett's profits from the sale of the book were less than the cost of having it typed.In 1896 Bennett was promoted to be editor of Woman; by then he had set his eyes on a career as a full-time author, but he served as editor for four years. During that time he wrote two popular books, described by his biographer John Lucas as \"pot-boilers\": Journalism for Women (1898) and Polite Farces for the Drawing Room (1899). He also began work on a second novel, Anna of the Five Towns, the five towns being Bennett's fictional Staffordshire locale, based on Hanley, Burslem and the neighbouring towns.\nFreelance; Paris\nIn 1900 Bennett resigned his post at Woman, and left London to set up house at Trinity Hall Farm, near the village of Hockliffe in Bedfordshire, where he made a home not only for himself but for his parents and younger sister. He completed Anna of the Five Towns in 1901; it was published the following year, as was its successor, The Grand Babylon Hotel, an extravagant story of crime in high society, which sold 50,000 copies in hardback and was translated into four languages. By this stage he was confident enough in his abilities to tell a friend:\n\n\nIn January 1902 Enoch Bennett died, after a decline into dementia. His widow chose to move back to Burslem and Bennett's sister married shortly afterwards. With no dependants, Bennett decided to move to Paris, where he took up residence in March. His reasons for doing so are not clear. Drabble speculates that perhaps \"he was hoping for some kind of liberation. He was thirty-five and unmarried\"; Lucas writes that it was almost certainly Bennett's desire to be recognised as a serious artist that prompted his move; according to Frank Swinnerton, Bennett was following in the footsteps of George Moore by going to live in \"the home of modern realism\"; in Reginald Pound's view it was \"to begin his career as a man of the world\".  The 9th arrondissement of Paris was Bennett's home for the next five years, first in the rue de Calais, near the Place Pigalle, and then the more upmarket rue d'Aumale.Life in Paris evidently helped Bennett overcome much of his remaining shyness with women. His journals for his early months in Paris mention a young woman identified as \"C\" or \"Chichi\", who was a chorus girl; the journals \u2013 or at least the cautiously selected extracts published since his death \u2013 do not record the precise nature of the relationship, but the two spent a considerable amount of time together.In a restaurant where he dined frequently a trivial incident in 1903 gave Bennett the germ of an idea for the novel generally regarded as his masterpiece. A grotesque old woman came in and caused a fuss; the beautiful young waitress laughed at her, and Bennett was struck by the thought that the old woman had once been as young and lovely as the waitress. From this grew the story of two contrasting sisters in The Old Wives' Tale. He did not begin work on that novel until 1907, before which he wrote ten others, some \"sadly undistinguished\", in the view of his biographer Kenneth Young. Throughout his career, Bennett interspersed his best novels with some that his biographers and others have labelled pot-boilers.\nMarriage; Fontainebleau\nIn 1905 Bennett became engaged to Eleanor Green, a member of an eccentric and unreliable American family living in Paris, but at the last moment, after the wedding invitations had been sent out, she broke off the engagement and swiftly married a fellow American. Drabble comments that Bennett was well rid of her, but it was a painful episode in his life. In early 1907 he met Marguerite Souli\u00e9 (1874\u20131960), who soon became first a friend and then a lover. In May he was taken ill with a severe gastric complaint, and Marguerite moved into his flat to look after him. They became still closer, and in July 1907, shortly after his fortieth birthday, they were married at the Mairie of the 9th arrondissement. The marriage was childless. Early in 1908 the couple moved from the rue d'Aumale to the Villa des N\u00e9fliers in Fontainebleau-Avon, about 40 miles (64\u00a0km) south east of Paris.Lucas comments that the best of the novels written while in France \u2013 Whom God Hath Joined (1906), The Old Wives' Tale (1908), and Clayhanger (1910) \u2013 \"justly established Bennett as a major exponent of realistic fiction\". In addition to these, Bennett published lighter novels such as The Card (1911). His output of literary journalism included articles for T. P. O'Connor's T.P.'s Weekly and the left-wing The New Age; his pieces for the latter, published under a pen-name, were concise literary essays aimed at \"the general cultivated reader\", a form taken up by a later generation of writers including J. B. Priestley and V. S. Pritchett.In 1911 Bennett paid a financially rewarding visit to the US, which he later recorded in his 1912 book Those United States. He sold the serial rights of his forthcoming novel, The Price of Love, to Harpers for \u00a32,000, eight essays to Metropolitan for a total of  \u00a31,200, and the American rights of a successor to Clayhanger for \u00a33,000. During his ten years in France he had gone from a moderately well-known writer enjoying modest sales to outstanding success. Swinnerton comments that in addition to his large sales, Bennett's critical prestige was at its zenith.\nReturn to England\nIn 1912 Bennett and his wife moved from France to England, where he bought Comarques, an early-18th-century country house at Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex. Among his early concerns, once back in England, was to succeed as a playwright. He had dabbled previously  but his inexperience showed. The Times thought his 1911 comedy The Honeymoon, staged in the West End with a starry cast, had \"one of the most amusing first acts we have ever seen\", but fell badly flat in the other two acts. In the same year Bennett met the playwright Edward Knoblauch (later Knoblock) and they collaborated on Milestones, the story of the generations of a family seen in 1860, 1885 and 1912. The combination of Bennett's narrative gift and Knoblauch's practical experience proved a success. The play was strongly cast, received highly favourable notices, ran for more than 600 performances in London and over 200 in New York, and made Bennett a great deal of money.Bennett's attitude to the First World War was that British politicians had been at fault in failing to prevent it, but that once it had become inevitable it was right that Britain should join its allies against the Germans. He turned his attention from writing plays and novels to his journalism, aiming to inform and encourage the public not only in Britain but also in allied and neutral countries. He served on official and unofficial committees, and in 1915 he was invited to visit France to see conditions at the front and write about them for readers at home. The collected impressions appeared in a book called Over There (1915). When Lord Beaverbrook became Minister of Information in February 1918 he appointed Bennett to take charge of propaganda in France. Beaverbrook fell ill in October 1918 and made Bennett director of propaganda, in charge of the whole ministry for the last weeks of the war. At the end of 1918 Bennett was offered, but declined, a knighthood in the new Order of the British Empire instituted by George V.As the war was ending, Bennett returned to his theatrical interests, although not primarily as a playwright. In November 1918 he became chairman, with Nigel Playfair as managing director, of the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. Among their productions were Abraham Lincoln by John Drinkwater, and The Beggar's Opera, which, in Swinnerton's phrase, \"caught different moods of the post-war spirit\", and ran for 466 and 1,463 performances respectively.\nLast years\nIn 1921, Bennett and his wife legally separated. They had been drifting apart for some years and Marguerite had taken up with Pierre Legros, a young French lecturer.  Bennett sold Comarques and lived in London for the rest of his life, first in a flat near Bond Street in the West End, which he had taken during the war. For much of the 1920s he was widely known to be the highest-paid literary journalist in England, contributing an influential weekly column to Beaverbrook's Evening Standard; by the end of his career, he had contributed to more than 100 newspapers, magazines and other publications. He continued to write novels and plays as assiduously as before the war.\nSwinnerton writes, \"Endless social engagements; inexhaustible patronage of musicians, actors, poets, and painters; the maximum of benevolence to friends and strangers alike, marked the last ten years of his life\". Hugh Walpole, James Agate and Osbert Sitwell were among those who testified to Bennett's generosity. Sitwell recalled a letter Bennett wrote in the 1920s:\nIn 1922 Bennett met and fell in love with an actress, Dorothy Cheston (1891\u20131977). Together they set up home in Cadogan Square and then in Chiltern Court, Baker Street. As Marguerite would not agree to a divorce, Bennett was unable to marry Dorothy, and in September 1928, having become pregnant, she changed her name by deed poll to Dorothy Cheston Bennett. The following April she gave birth to the couple's only child, Virginia Mary (1929\u20132003). She continued to appear as an actress, and produced and starred in a revival of Milestones which was well reviewed, but had only a moderate run. Bennett had mixed feelings about her continuing stage career, but did not seek to stop it.During a holiday in France with Dorothy in January 1931, Bennett twice drank tap-water \u2013 not, at the time, a safe thing to do there. On his return home he was taken ill; influenza was diagnosed at first, but the illness was typhoid fever; after several weeks of unsuccessful treatment he died in his flat at Chiltern Court on 27 March 1931, aged 63.Bennett was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and his ashes were interred in Burslem cemetery in his mother's grave. A memorial service was held on 31 March 1931 at St Clement Danes, London, attended by leading figures from journalism, literature, music, politics and theatre, and, in Pound's words, many men and women who at the end of the service \"walked out into a London that for them would never be the same again\".\nWorks\nFrom the outset, Bennett believed in the \"democratisation of art which it is surely the duty of the minority to undertake\". He admired some of the modernist writers of his time, but strongly disapproved of their conscious appeal to a small \u00e9lite and their disdain for the general reader. Bennett believed that literature should be inclusive, accessible by ordinary people.From the start of his career, Bennett was aware of the appeal of regional fiction. Anthony Trollope, George Eliot and Thomas Hardy had created and sustained their own locales, and Bennett did the same with his Five Towns, drawing on his experiences as a boy and young man. As a realistic writer he followed the examples of the authors he admired \u2013 above all George Moore, but also Balzac, Flaubert and Maupassant among French writers, and Dostoevsky, Turgenev and Tolstoy among Russians. In writing about the Five Towns Bennett aimed to establish himself as a realistic writer, portraying the experiences of ordinary people coping with the norms and constraints of the communities in which they lived. J. B. Priestley considered that the next influence on Bennett's fiction was his time in London in the 1890s, \"engaged in journalism and ingenious pot-boiling of various kinds\".\nNovels and short stories\nBennett is remembered chiefly for his novels and short stories. The best known are set in, or feature people from, the six towns of the Potteries of his youth. He presented the region as \"the Five Towns\" because he found the phrase \"the Six Towns\" less aesthetically pleasing. His Five Towns correspond closely with their originals: the real-life Burslem, Hanley, Longton, Stoke and Tunstall become Bennett's Bursley, Hanbridge, Longshaw, Knype and Turnhill. These novels portray the Five Towns with what The Oxford Companion to English Literature calls \"an ironic but affectionate detachment, describing provincial life and culture in documentary detail, and creating many memorable characters\". It was not only locations on which Bennett drew for his fiction. Many of his characters are discernibly based on real people in his life. His Lincoln's Inn friend John Eland was the source for Mr Aked in Bennett's first novel, A Man from the North; A Great Man (1903) contains a character with echoes of his Parisienne friend Chichi;  Darius Clayhanger's early life is based on that of a family friend and Bennett himself is seen in Edwin in Clayhanger. He has been criticised for making literary use in that novel of the distressing details of his father's decline into senility, but in Pound's view, in committing the details to paper Bennett was unburdening himself of painful memories.Bennett usually gave his novels subtitles; the most frequent was \"A fantasia on modern themes\", individual books were called \"A frolic\" or \"A melodrama\", but he was sparing with the label \"A novel\" which he used only five times \u2013 for Anna of the Five Towns (1902), Sacred and Profane Love (1905), The Old Wives' Tale (1908), The Pretty Lady (1918) and Riceyman Steps (1923).Literary critics have followed Bennett in dividing his novels into groups. The literary scholar Kurt Koenigsberger proposes three categories. In the first are the long narratives \u2013 \"freestanding, monumental artefacts\" \u2013 Anna of the Five Towns, The Old Wives' Tale, Clayhanger (1910), and Riceyman Steps, which \"have been held in high critical regard since their publication\". Koenigsberger writes that the \"Fantasias\" such as The Grand Babylon Hotel (1902), Teresa of Watling Street (1904), and The City of Pleasure (1907), have \"mostly passed from public attention along with the 'modern' conditions they exploit\". His third group includes \"Idyllic Diversions\" or \"Stories of Adventure\", including Helen with the High Hand (1910), The Card (1911), and The Regent (1913), which \"have sustained some enduring critical and popular interest, not least for their amusing treatment of cosmopolitanism and provinciality\".Bennett published 96 short stories in seven volumes between 1905 and 1931. His ambivalence about his native town is vividly seen in \"The Death of Simon Fuge\" in the collection The Grim Smile of the Five Towns (1907), judged by Lucas the finest of all the stories; but his chosen locations ranged widely, including Paris and Venice as well as London and the Five Towns. As with his novels, he would sometimes give a story a label, calling \"The Matador of the Five Towns\" (1912) \"a tragedy\" and \"Jock-at-a-Venture\" from the same collection \"a frolic\". The short stories, particularly those in  Tales of the Five Towns (1905), The Grim Smile of the Five Towns (1907), and The Matador of the Five Towns contain some of the most striking examples of Bennett's concern for realism, with an unflinching narrative focus on what Lucas calls \"the drab, the squalid, and the mundane\".More recently, two further volumes of Bennett's hitherto uncollected short stories have been published: these range from his earliest work written in the 1890s, some under the pseudonym Sarah Volatile, to US magazine commissions from the late 1920s.\nStage and screen\nIn 1931 the critic Graham Sutton, looking back at Bennett's career in the theatre, contrasted his achievements as a playwright with those as a novelist, suggesting that Bennett was a complete novelist but a not-entirely-complete dramatist. His plays were clearly those of a novelist: \"He tends to lengthy speeches. Sometimes he overwrites a part, as though distrusting the actor. He is more interested in what his people are than in what they visibly do. He 'thinks nowt' of mere slickness of plot.\"\nBennett's lack of a theatrical grounding showed in the uneven construction of some of his plays. A successful first act followed by much weaker second and third acts was noted in his 1911 comedy The Honeymoon, which played for 125 performances from October 1911. The highly successful Milestones was seen as impeccably constructed, but the credit for that was given to his craftsmanlike collaborator, Edward Knoblauch (Bennett being credited with the inventive flair of the piece). By far his most successful solo effort in the theatre was The Great Adventure, based on his 1908 novel Buried Alive, which ran in the West End for 674 performances, from March 1913 to November 1914. Sutton praised its \"new strain of impish and sardonic fantasy\" and rated it a much finer play than Milestones.After the First World War Bennett wrote two plays on metaphysical questions, Sacred and Profane Love (1919, adapted from his novel) and Body and Soul (1922), which made little impression. The Saturday Review praised the \"shrewd wit\" of the former, but thought it \"false in its essentials\u00a0... superficial in its accidentals\". Of the latter, the critic Horace Shipp wondered \"how the author of Clayhanger and The Old Wives' Tale could write such third-rate stuff\". Bennett had more success in a final collaboration with Edward Knoblock (as Knoblauch had become during the war) with Mr Prohack (1927), a comedy based on his 1922 novel; one critic wrote \"I could have enjoyed the play had it run to double its length\", but even so he judged the middle act weaker than the outer two. Sutton concludes that Bennett's forte was character, but that the competence of his technique was variable. The plays are seldom revived, although some have been adapted for television.Bennett wrote two opera libretti for the composer Eugene Goossens: Judith (one act, 1929) and Don Juan (four acts, produced in 1937 after the writer's death). There were comments that Goossens's music lacked tunes and Bennett's libretti were too wordy and literary. The critic Ernest Newman defended both works, finding Bennett's libretto for Judith \"a drama told simply and straightforwardly\" and Don Juan \"the best thing that English opera has so far produced \u2026 the most dramatic and stageworthy\", but though politely received, both operas vanished from the repertory after a few performances.Bennett took a keen interest in  the cinema, and in 1920 wrote The Wedding Dress, a scenario for a silent  movie, at the request of Jesse Lasky of the Famous  Players film company. It was never made, though Bennett wrote a full-length treatment, assumed to be lost until his daughter Virginia found it in a drawer in her Paris home in 1983; subsequently the script was sold to the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery and was finally published in 2013.In 1928 Bennett wrote the  scenario for the silent film Piccadilly, directed by E. A. Dupont and starring Anna May Wong, described by the BFI as \"one of  the true greats of British silent films, on a par with the best work of or in  the period\".  In 1929, the year the film came out, Bennett was in discussion with a young Alfred Hitchcock to script a silent film Punch and Judy, which foundered on artistic disagreements and  Bennett's refusal to see the film as a \"talkie\" rather than silent. His original scenario, acquired by Pennsylvania State University, was published in the UK in 2012.\nJournals\nInspired by those of the Goncourt brothers, Bennett kept a journal throughout his adult life. Swinnerton says that it runs to a million words; it has not been published in full. Edited extracts were issued in three volumes, in 1932 and 1933. According to Hugh Walpole, the editor, Newman Flower, \"was so appalled by much of what he found in the journals that he published only brief extracts, and those the safest\". Whatever Flower censored, the extracts he selected were not always \"the safest\": he let some defamatory remarks through, and in 1935 he, the publishers and printers had to pay an undisclosed sum to the plaintiff in one libel suit and \u00a32,500 in another.\nCritical reputation\nNovels and short stories\nThe literary modernists of his day deplored Bennett's books, and those of his well-known contemporaries H. G. Wells and John Galsworthy. Of the three, Bennett drew the most opprobrium from modernists such as Virginia Woolf, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis who regarded him as representative of an outmoded and rival literary culture. There was a strong element of class-consciousness and snobbery in the modernists' attitude: Woolf accused Bennett of having \"a shopkeeper's view of literature\".In a 1963 study of Bennett, James Hepburn summed up and dissented from the prevailing views of the novels:\n\n\nHepburn countered that one of the novels most frequently praised by literary critics is Riceyman Steps (1923) set in Clerkenwell, London, and dealing with material imagined rather than observed by the author. On the third point he commented that although received wisdom was that The Old Wives' Tale and Clayhanger are good and Sacred and Profane Love and Lillian are bad, there was little consensus about which other Bennett novels were good, bad or indifferent. He instanced The Pretty Lady (1918), on which critical opinion ranged from \"cheap and sensational\"\u00a0... \"sentimental melodrama\" to \"a great novel\". Lucas (2004) considers it \"a much underrated study of England during the war years, especially in its sensitive feeling for the destructive frenzy that underlay much apparently good-hearted patriotism\".In 1974 Margaret Drabble published Arnold Bennett, a literary biography. In the foreword she demurred at the critical dismissal of Bennett:\n\n\nWriting in the 1990s the literary critic John Carey called for a reappraisal of Bennett in his book The Intellectuals and the Masses (1992):\n\n\nIn 2006 Koenigsberger commented that one reason why Bennett's novels had been sidelined, apart from \"the exponents of modernism who recoiled from his democratising aesthetic programme\", was his attitude to gender. His books include the pronouncements \"the average man has more intellectual power than the average woman\" and \"women as a sex love to be dominated\"; Koenigsberger nevertheless praises Bennett's \"sensitive and oft-praised portrayals of female figures in his fiction\".Lucas concludes his study, \"The limits of Bennett's realism perhaps lie in his cautious assumption that as things are, so they must be. Nevertheless, at its finest, Bennett's work has rightly commended itself to successive generations of readers and is certain to continue to do so\".\nCrime fiction\nBennett dabbled in crime fiction, in The Grand Babylon Hotel and The Loot of Cities. In Queen's Quorum (1951), a survey of crime fiction, Ellery Queen listed the latter among the 100 most important works in the genre. This collection of stories recounts the adventures of a millionaire who commits crimes to achieve his idealistic ends. Although it was \"one of his least known works,\" it was nevertheless \"of unusual interest, both as an example of Arnold Bennett's early work and as an early example of dilettante detectivism\".\nLegacy\nSociety\nThe Arnold Bennett Society was founded in 1954 \"to promote the study and appreciation of the life, works and times not only of Arnold Bennett himself but also of other provincial writers, with particular relationship to North Staffordshire\". In 2020 its president was Denis Eldin, Bennett's grandson; a vice-president was Bennett's son-in-law, Jacques Eldin, widower of the author's only child, Virginia.In 2017 the society instituted an annual Arnold Bennett Prize as part of author's 150th anniversary celebrations, to be awarded to an author who was born, lives or works in North Staffordshire and has published a book in the relevant year, or to the author of a book which features the region. In 2017 the award was won by John Lancaster for his poetry collection Potters: A Division of Labour. Subsequent winners have been Jan Edwards for her novel Winter Downs (2018), Charlotte Higgins for Red Thread: On Mazes and Labyrinths (2019) and Lisa Blower for her story collection It's Gone Dark Over Bill's Mother's (2020).\nPlaques and statuary\nBennett has been commemorated by several plaques. Hugh Walpole unveiled one at Comarques in 1931, and in the same year another was placed at Bennett's birthplace in Hanley. A plaque to and bust of Bennett were unveiled in Burslem in 1962, and there are blue plaques commemorating him at the house in Cadogan Square where he lived from 1923 to 1930 and on the house in Cobridge where he lived in his youth. The southern Baker Street entrance of Chiltern Court has a plaque to Bennett on the left and another to H. G. Wells on the right. A blue plaque has been placed on the wall of Bennett's home in Fontainebleau.There is a two-metre-high bronze statue of Bennett outside the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery in Hanley, unveiled in June 2017 during the events marking the 150th anniversary of his birth.\nOmelettes\nBennett shares with the composer Gioachino Rossini, the singer Nellie Melba and some other celebrities the distinction of having a well-known dish named in his honour. An omelette Arnold Bennett is one that incorporates smoked haddock, hard cheese (typically Cheddar), and cream. It was created at the Savoy Grill for Bennett, who was an habitu\u00e9, by the chef Jean Baptiste Virlogeux. It remains a British classic; cooks from Marcus Wareing to Delia Smith and Gordon Ramsay have published their recipes for it, and (in 2020) it remains on the menu at the Savoy Grill.\nNotes, references and sources\nNotes\nReferences\n\nSources\nFurther reading\nShapcott, John  (2017).

He has been called a \"precursor of Surrealism\". In addition to over a hundred short stories, he wrote journalistic articles, essays, biographies, literary reviews and analysis, translations and plays. He was extremely well known and respected during his life and notably befriended a great numbers of intellectuals and artists of the time.\n\nEarly life (1867\u201389)\nHe was born in Chaville, Hauts-de-Seine on 23 August 1867 into a cultivated Jewish family. His father, George Schwob, was a friend of Th\u00e9odore de Banville and Th\u00e9ophile Gautier. His mother, Mathilde Cahun, came from a family of intellectuals from Alsace. He was the brother of Maurice Schwob and uncle of Claude Cahun (born Lucy Schwob).\nHis family had just returned from Egypt, where his father had headed the cabinet of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for ten years. When the French Third Republic began, the Schwob family lived in Tours, where George became the director of the newspaper Le R\u00e9publicain d'Indre-et-Loire. In 1876, he moved to Nantes to direct the Republican daily Le Phare de la Loire; after he died in 1892, his eldest son Maurice, born in 1859, took his place.\nAt age 11 he discovered the work of Edgar Allan Poe translated by Charles Baudelaire. He then read the original versions of his tales in English and they proved to be a lifelong influence in his writing. In 1878\u201379, he studied at the Lyc\u00e9e of Nantes where he won the 1st Prize for Excellence. In 1881, he was sent to Paris to live with his maternal uncle L\u00e9on Cahun, Chief Librarian of the Mazarine Library, and continue his studies at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand, where he became friends with L\u00e9on Daudet and Paul Claudel. He developed a gift for languages and quickly became multilingual. In 1884, he discovered Robert Louis Stevenson, who was to become one of his friends and role models. He studied philology and Sanscrit under Ferdinand de Saussure at the \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes in 1883\u201384. He then completed his military service in Vannes, joining the artillery.\nHe failed his entrance exams for the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure, but he earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1888. He became a professional journalist, collaborating in the Phare de la Loire, the \u00c9v\u00e9nement and L'\u00c9cho de Paris.\n\nEarly work (1890\u20131897)\nHe had a passion for French slang, and in particular for the language of the Coquillards used by Villon in his Ballads in Jargon: unlike the widespread opinion at the time (developed by Victor Hugo in Les Mis\u00e9rables), Schwob considered that slang is not a language that is created spontaneously, but that it is actually an artificial language in code.\nFor eight years he wrote short stories that were collected in six books: C\u0153ur double (\"Double Heart\", 1891), Le roi au masque d'or (\"The King in the Golden Mask\", 1892), Mimes (1893), Le livre de Monelle (\"The Book of Monelle\", 1894), La croisade des enfants (\"The Children's Crusade\", 1896) and Vies imaginaires (\"Imaginary Lives\", 1896). His last short story, \"L'\u00e9toile de bois,\" is the longest one he wrote and was published in 1897. Two large reprint collections of his stories were published during his lifetime: La porte des r\u00eaves (The Gate of Dreams, 1899), illustrated by Georges de Feure, and La lampe de Psych\u00e9 (Psyche's Lamp, 1903).\nAlong with Stuart Merrill, Adolphe Rett\u00e9 and Pierre Lou\u00ffs, Marcel Schwob worked on Oscar Wilde's play Salome, which was written in French to avoid a British law forbidding the depiction of Bible characters on stage. Wilde struggled with his French, and the play was proofread and corrected by Marcel Schwob for its first performance in Paris in 1896.\n\nLate work (1898\u20131905)\nIn the last eight years of his life Schwob was often too sick to work, but he managed to complete a number of projects, although with the exception of the play Jane Shore, and \"Dialogues d'Utopie\" (written in 1905), he never wrote any more original fiction. He did write articles, introductions and essays, adapted and translated several plays, and planned or began numerous projects that remained unfinished when he died.\n\nTravels\nTing Tse-Ying was a young Chinese scholar from the Island of Saint-Louis, fluent in English, that Schwob had met at the Chinese pavilion at the closing of Paris's Exposition Universelle and hired as a domestic servant, personal assistant and traveling companion. Ting later worked for explorer Paul Pelliot, whom he accompanied to Turkestan.In 1901, assisted by Ting, he travelled first to Jersey, where he stayed for several weeks, and then to Uriage, trying to improve his health. He then began the biggest voyage of his life, traveling to Samoa, like his hero Stevenson, in search of his tomb. Leaving from Marseilles, he stopped in Port Said, Djibouti, Aden, toured Sri Lanka, Sydney and finally Vailima, where Stevenson had lived. There, he met people who had known Stevenson. He stayed for a little less than a month. He became very sick in the island, lost a lot of weight and was forced to return to Paris in a hurry without having visited the tomb. Because of regional racism, Ting was arrested on several occasions and prevented from accompanying Schwob in some parts of the trip. Schwob complained about this in his letters to Moreno.In 1904, at the invitation of Francis Marion Crawford and accompanied by Ting, he took a boat trip to Naples, stopping in Porto, Lisbon, Barcelona, Marseille and finally Naples. He stayed for two weeks in Crawford's villa in Sant'Agnello in Sorrento. Bored, he left for France, stopping in Aix-les-Bains where his wife joined him. He then went to the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland, the Plombi\u00e8res in Belgium and finally Carnac, where Moreno, once again, joined him. His health had further worsened and they returned to Paris.\n\nPersonal life\nFriendships\nThroughout his life, Schwob associated with or befriended a great number of notables from the worlds of art and literature. They include L\u00e9on Daudet, Paul Claudel, Anatole France, Edmond de Goncourt, Jean Lorrain, J.-H. Rosny a\u00een\u00e9, Alphonse Daudet, Auguste Br\u00e9al, Paul Ar\u00e8ne, Maurice Spronck, Jules Renard, Paul Margueritte, Paul Hervieu, Charles Maurras, Rachilde, Octave Mirbeau, Catulle Mend\u00e8s, Jules Renard, Guillaume Apollinaire, Henri Barbusse, Georges Courteline, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Colette, Oscar Wilde, Pierre Lou\u00ffs, George Meredith, Maurice Maeterlinck, Alfred Jarry, Aristide Bruant, Marcel Proust, Robert de Montesquiou, \u00c9douard Manet, Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel and Jehan Rictus.\nIn 1903 Schwob reflected on the passing of several of his closest friends, all cultural celebrities at the time. He wrote to Edmund Gosse: \"I have been sadly tried in my friends since a few years. Stevenson and Verlaine, Mallarm\u00e9 and now Henley and Whistler are gone\". Aleister Crowley also considered Schwob a friend and asked him to translate two of his sonnets: \"Rodin\" and \"Balzac\". Schwob was also friends with Lucien Guitry and tried to help him reconcile with his son, Sacha Guitry. Decades later Sacha went on to make several films with Marguerite Moreno.\n\nRelationships\nThe two loves of his life were a young woman known as Louise and the celebrated actress Marguerite Moreno. Schwob met Louise, a working-class girl who might have been a prostitute, in 1891, when he was 24 years old and she was 23. He kept the relationship hidden and exchanged letters with her, most of which he later mostly destroyed. After two years she died of tuberculosis. He was devastated and confided in many of his friends. He dedicated Le livre de Monelle to her, basing the central character on Louise, but turning her into a child of indeterminate age. Many consider this his most personal work, and it is the single book for which he became best known during his lifetime. The year after Louise's death, 1894, Schwob met Marguerite Moreno, who, at 23, had been named by St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 \"the sacred muse of Symbolism\", and was the lover of Catulle Mend\u00e8s. She had posed for sculptor Jean Dampt, artists Edmond Aman-Jean, Joseph Grani\u00e9 and often for Lucien L\u00e9vy-Dhurmer. In January 1895 they were officially together and they were married in London five years later, in 1900. Charles Whibley, the English writer, was a witness at the wedding. Their relationship was unconventional. They spent much time apart, due to Moreno's career and Schwob's frequent travels.\n\nHealth and death\nHe became sick in 1896 with a chronic incurable intestinal disorder. He also suffered from recurring conditions that were generally diagnosed as influenza or pneumonia, and he received intestinal surgery several times. After two surgeries by doctor Joaquin Albarr\u00e1n, Robert de Montesquiou recommended the care of the well-known doctor and surgeon Samuel Jean de Pozzi, who had been lovers with Sarah Bernhard and was later painted by John Singer Sargent. At first his treatments had some positive effects, relieving Schwob from his constant pain. In appreciation, Schwob dedicated La porte des r\u00eaves to him. But by 1900, after two more surgeries, Pozzi told him that he could not do anything else for him. In the following years he ate only kefir and fermented milk. In February 1905, after nine years of serious recurring episodes, he died of pneumonia while his wife was away on tour, performing in Aix-en-Provence. He was surrounded by Ting, his brother Maurice and his biographer Pierre Champion.\nTeaching\nStarting in December 1904 he taught a course on Villon at the \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes that was attended by, among others, Michel Br\u00e9al, \u00c9douard and Pierre Champion, Paul Fort, Max Jacob, Auguste Longnon, Pablo Picasso, Catherine Pozzi (daughter of one of his doctors), Andr\u00e9 Salmon and Louis Thomas.\n\nDedications\nPaul Val\u00e9ry dedicated two of his works to him - Introduction \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode de L\u00e9onard de Vinci and the Soir\u00e9e avec M. Teste.\nAlfred Jarry dedicated his Ubu Roi to Schwob.\nOscar Wilde dedicated to him his long poem \"The Sphinx\" (1894) \"in friendship and admiration.\"Influence\nThe Book of Monelle, in 1894, influenced The Fruits of the Earth by Andr\u00e9 Gide (Schwob accused Gide of plagiarism).\nThe Children's Crusade influenced William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying and Jerzy Andrzejewski's The Gates of Paradise.\nMax Ernst quoted him in Une semaine de bont\u00e9 (1934).\nJorge Luis Borges wrote that his book Historia universal de la infamia (A Universal History of Infamy, 1936) was inspired by Schwob's Imaginary Lives.Misinformation\nAn often repeated, yet baseless rumor, states that Schwob died from syphilis. It seems to have its origins in the book The Love that Dared Not Speak Its Name by H. Montgomery Hyde, in which he wrote that Schwob died from the \"effects of a syphilitic tumor in the rectum, which he acquired as a result of anal intercourse with an infected youth.\" This apocryphal theory contradicts almost everything that is known about Schwob's health and sexual activities. Schwob received treatments for syphilis on two occasions, but that does not seem to be the reason for his deteriorating health.His birth name, Mayer Andr\u00e9 Marcel Schwob, is clearly indicated on both his birth certificate and marriage license, both in the possession of the Harold B. Lee Library of Brigham Young University. Despite this well-documented fact, several biographical texts erroneously continue to list his \"real name\" as \"Andr\u00e9 Marcel Mayer\" and \"Marcel Schwob\" as an alias.\n\nWorks\nCollections of short stories\n\nC\u0153ur double (\"Double Heart\", 1891)\nLe roi au masque d'or (\"The King in the Golden Mask\", 1892)\nMimes (1893)\nLe livre de Monelle (\"The Book of Monelle\", 1894)\nLa croisade des enfants (\"The Children's Crusade\", 1896)\nVies imaginaires (\"Imaginary Lives\", 1896)\nLa porte des r\u00eaves (1899), collecting eleven stories selected from C\u0153ur double, Le roi au masque d'or and Le livre de Monelle.\nLa lampe de Psych\u00e9 (1903), collecting Mimes, La croisade des enfants, Le livre de Monelle and \"L'\u00e9toile de bois\"Stories not collected during his lifetime\n\n\"L'\u00e9pingle d'or\" (1889)\n\"Articles d'exportation\" (1890)\n\"Les noces du Tibre\"  (1890)\n\"Blanches-mains\", \"La d\u00e9moniaque\", \"Barbe-Noire\" (1892)\n\"Rampsinit\", \"L'origine\", La maison close\", \"La main de gloire\" (1893)\n\"Vie de Morphiel, demiurge\", an uncollected chapter of Vies imaginaires (1895)\n\"Dialogues d'Utopie\" (1905)\n\"Maua\", a private unpublished text (first printed in 2009)Other stories\n\n\"Le deuxi\u00e8me Ph\u00e9don\" and \"L'\u00cele de la libert\u00e9\" (1892).

His father was the novelist Alphonse Daudet, his mother was Julia Daudet and his younger brother, Lucien Daudet, would also become an artist. He was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis le Grand, and afterwards studied medicine, a profession which he abandoned. L\u00e9on Daudet married Jeanne Hugo, the granddaughter of Victor Hugo, in 1891 and thus entered into the higher social and intellectual circles of the French Third Republic. He divorced his wife in 1895 and became a vocal critic of the Republic, the Dreyfusard camp, and of democracy in general.Together with Charles Maurras (who remained a lifelong friend), he co-founded (1907) and was an editor of the nationalist, integralist periodical Action Fran\u00e7aise. A deputy from 1919 to 1924, he failed to win election as a senator in 1927 \u2013 despite having gained prominence as the voice of the monarchists. When Maurras was released from prison after serving a sentence for verbally attacking Prime Minister L\u00e9on Blum, Daudet joined other political leaders Xavier Vallat, Darquier de Pellepoix, and Philippe Henriot to welcome him in the Vel' d'Hiv in July 1937.\n\nScandals and later life\nWhen his son Philippe committed suicide in 1923, Daudet accused the republican authorities of complicity with anarchist activists in what he believed to be a murder, and lost a lawsuit for defamation brought against him by the driver of the taxi in which Philippe's body was found. Condemned to five months in prison, Daudet fled and was exiled in Belgium, receiving a pardon in 1930. In 1934, during the Stavisky Affair, he was to denounce Prime Minister Camille Chautemps, calling him the \"leader of a gang of robbers and assassins\". He also showed particular detestation for the subsequent Prime Minister L\u00e9on Blum, candidate of a coalition of socialists and other parties of the left.\nA supporter of the Vichy administration headed by Marshal P\u00e9tain, L\u00e9on Daudet died in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence.\n\nWorks\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAlden, Douglas William (1940).

His Dharma name was Shungy\u014din Ryokuu Suikaku Koji (\u6625\u6681\u9662\u7dd1\u96e8\u9192\u5ba2\u5c45\u58eb), which was chosen by K\u014dda Rohan.\n\nBiography\nIn 1896, with Mori \u014cgai (\u68ee \u9dd7\u5916) and K\u014dda Rohan (\u5e78\u7530 \u9732\u4f34), Ryokuu started a literary journal, Mezamashi gusa (\u3081\u3055\u307e\u3057\u8349) in which Takekurabe (\u305f\u3051\u304f\u3089\u3079) by Higuchi Ichiy\u014d (\u6a0b\u53e3 \u4e00\u8449) was met with high critical acclaim. After Ichiy\u014d died on November of that year, Ryokuu helped her mother and sister make a living although he was far from being well-off. His literary friends include K\u014dtoku Sh\u016bsui (\u5e78\u5fb3 \u79cb\u6c34), Baba Koch\u014d (\u99ac\u5834 \u5b64\u8776) and Yosano Tekkan (\u4e0e\u8b1d\u91ce \u9244\u5e79).\nRyokuu was a distinguished aphorist, as well as one of the most outspoken critics. Collections of his aphorisms were published in the late 20th century.\nIn 1904, the tuberculosis which had plagued Ryokuu for years worsened, and no medical care helped him recuperate. On his deathbed, he referred Ichiy\u014d's diaries, which he had hoped to publish, to Baba Koch\u014d, and dictated him his own obituary. He died in the morning of 13 April of the same year.\n\nSee also\nJapanese literature\nList of Japanese writers\nWriters from JapanExternal links\n\u4f5c\u5bb6\u5225\u4f5c\u54c1\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\uff1a\u658e\u85e4 \u7dd1\u96e8 Aozora Bunko page for Sait\u014d Ryokuu\n\n\n\n","63":"Yamada Bimy\u014d (\u5c71\u7530 \u7f8e\u5999), born Yamada Taketar\u014d (\u5c71\u7530 \u6b66\u592a\u90ce, 1868\u20131910), was a Japanese novelist.Jim Reichert, author of Yamada Bimy\u014d: Historical Fiction and Modern Love, wrote that Bimy\u014d was \"one of the most influential literary reformers of the 1880s\" who had \"an instrumental role\" in producing rekishi sh\u014dsetsu, the modern form of a Japanese historical novel. According to Reichert, during the 1880s the public perceived Bimy\u014d \"to be at the forefront of the literary reform movement, offering a fresh and exciting strategy for reforming Japanese literature.\"Louis Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, author of the Japan Encyclopedia, wrote that Bimy\u014d was, along with K\u014dda Rohan, \"the most representative authors\" of the first modern school of literature to appear in Meiji Japan.\nHistory\nBimy\u014d was a part of the \"Ken'y\u016bsha\" (\"Friends of the Inkstone\") Meiji literary group formed in February 1885, along with Ozaki K\u014dy\u014d, Ishibashi Shian, and Maruoka Ky\u016bka.Bimy\u014d married the writer Tazawa Inabune (Tazawa Kin) after she traveled to Tokyo to meet him. At the time, Bimy\u014d's financial situation was deteriorating, and Inabune's family was wealthy. Yukiko Tanaka, author of Women Writers of Meiji and Taisho Japan: Their Lives, Works and Critical Reception, 1868-1926, stated that the marriage would not have occurred if his financial troubles did not exist.During the marriage Bimy\u014d had affairs with other women. Bimy\u014d told Ozaki K\u014dy\u014d, who criticized his affairs, that the dalliances were to enhance his artistic abilities. The marriage attracted scrutiny from the press, and after three months Bimy\u014d and Inabune divorced, and Inabune was forced to return home.The man's relationships with his colleagues eventually deteriorated. Bimy\u014d's ex-wife died in 1896, and many newspapers erroneously reported that she had committed suicide. Melek Ortabasi, author of \"Tazawa Inabune (1874-1896)\", wrote that Inabune's death ended Bimy\u014d's career \"in large part\" because Bimy\u014d received criticism for how he had treated Inabune.Bimy\u014d died at age 42. At the time of his death he was in a poor economic situation. In 2006 Reichert stated that Bimy\u014d had \"faded into relative obscurity\".\nWriting style\nTomi Suzuki, author of Narrating the Self: Fictions of Japanese Modernity, wrote that Bimy\u014d's writing style \"was in fact far from the spoken languages of the time.\" Bimy\u014d favored genbun-itchi (\u8a00\u6587\u4e00\u81f4), which means unifying spoken and written language, and also used Western literature features including different grammatical persons, ellipses, passive voice, personification, and Western tense styles.

His family emigrated to the United States in 1885. After a youthful period in Iowa, he spent much of his life moving back and forth between London, Paris and New York. His best-known work was Their Day in Court, a 1909 book of literary and cultural commentary. His works reflect his dislike for naturalism, and disdain for the commercial tastes of the masses, promoting instead aestheticism and literary impressionism. A good friend of both Ambrose Bierce and H.L. Mencken, Mencken wrote of him warmly in the first series of his work Prejudices, comparing Pollard favorably to contemporary and fellow American aesthete James Huneker. Pollard was also noted as an early advocate of James Branch Cabell and the initial works of Robert W. Chambers.\nOther works include Dreams of To-day (1907), a  book of decadent 'weird tales' in the vein of Chambers' the King in Yellow, the critical study Masks and Minstrels of New Germany (1911), the novels The Imitator (1901) and Lingo Dan (1903), as well as a play written in collaboration with Leo Ditrichstein, The Ambitious Mrs. Alcott, which opened and closed  after 24 performances on Broadway in 1907. Pollard, aged 42, died unexpectedly from \"brain neuritis\" in 1911 in Baltimore, cutting short a promising career. Mencken and Bierce attended his funeral. His cremated remains were sent back to Iowa. A 1947 Ph.D. dissertation, Percival Pollard: Precursor of the Twenties, by George Nicholas Kummer of New York University, has remained in unpublished typescript form.\n\nBibliography\nThe Cape of Storms (1892) [1]\nMiniature Dreams (1893)\nPosters in Miniature (1896)\nThe Kiss That Killed (1898)\nThe Imitator (1901) [2]\nLingo Dan (1903)\nIn Memoriam: Oscar Wilde (1905, as translator) [3]\nDreams of To-day (1907)\nThe Ambitious Mrs. Alcott (1907, with Leo Ditrichstein)\nTheir Day in Court (1909) [4]\nMasks and Minstrels of New Germany (1911)[5]\nVagabond Journeys: the Human Comedy at Home and Abroad (1911) [6]References\nMay, Henry F.

His works often deal with melancholy and lovelorn characters, and offer a rich portrayal of contemporary Stockholm through the eyes of the flaneur. S\u00f6derberg is greatly appreciated in his native country, and is sometimes considered to be the equal of August Strindberg.\nBiography\nBorn in Stockholm, S\u00f6derberg began his literary course at the Swedish news daily Svenska Dagbladet, age 20. Six years later his first novel was released, F\u00f6rvillelser (Delusions, 1895), written from the viewpoint of a young dandy aimlessly idling in the capital, recklessly squandering money and love. The somber yet reflective and insightful story would prove typical of much of S\u00f6derberg's output. Subsequent to the release of Historietter (Anecdotes, 1898), a collection of twenty short stories, his next major work \u2013 Martin Bircks Ungdom (Martin Birck's Youth, 1901) \u2013 was released. Much like F\u00f6rvillelser in terms of its vivid environmental depiction and acute perception, it follows the development of a young amateur poet. S\u00f6derberg's next novel, by some considered his masterpiece, was Doktor Glas (Doctor Glas, 1905). In a frightful tale of vengeance and passion, S\u00f6derberg stays true to his detached yet emotionally poignant writing style.\nIn his later years, S\u00f6derberg turned to journalism and theological studies. He was a fierce critic of Nazism, and wrote often on the subject in the revered Resistance paper G\u00f6teborgs Handels- och Sj\u00f6fartstidning. He died in Denmark and is buried on Vestre Kirkeg\u00e5rd in Copenhagen.\nS\u00f6derberg was married to M\u00e4rta Abenius (b. 1871, d. 1932) between the years 1899\u20131917. They had three children: actress Dora S\u00f6derberg-Carlsten (b. 1899), Tom S\u00f6derberg (b. 1900) and Mikael S\u00f6derberg (b. 1903). From 1917 he was married in Denmark to Emelie Voss (b. 1876, d. 1957), with whom he had one child: actress Betty S\u00f8derberg (b. 1910).\nS\u00f6derberg had for a number of years a stormy on \/ off relationship with Maria von Platen (b. 1871, d.1959), a relationship which is said to have influenced him in his writing, especially his 1906 play Gertrud, and for the character of Lydia in The Serious Game.\nA recent reissue of Paul Britten Austin's translation of Doktor Glas into English, as Doctor Glas, and with a perceptive introduction by Margaret Atwood, has meant a rise in his popularity in the Anglo-Saxon literary world.\n\nQuotations\n\"I believe in the lust of the flesh and the incurable isolation of the soul.\" (From Doctor Glas, later used in Gertrud)\n\"One wants to be loved, in lack thereof admired, in lack thereof feared, in lack thereof loathed and despised.

His most famous work is Bambi, a Life in the Woods (1923).\n\nLife and death\nSalten was born 6 September 1869 as Siegmund Salzmann in Pest, Austria-Hungary. He was the grandson of an Orthodox rabbi. When he was four weeks old, his family relocated to Vienna, Austria. Many Jews were immigrating into the city during the late 19th century because Vienna had granted full citizenship to Jews in 1867.\nWhen his father became bankrupt, the sixteen-year-old Salten quit school and began working for an insurance agency. He also began submitting poems and book reviews to journals. He became part of the \"Young Vienna\" movement (Jung Wien) and soon received work as a full-time art and theater critic for Vienna's press (Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung, Zeit). In 1900, he published his first collection of short stories. In 1901, he initiated Vienna's first, short-lived literary cabaret Jung-Wiener Theater Zum lieben Augustin.\nHe was soon publishing, on an average, one book a year, of plays, short stories, novels, travel books, and essay collections. He also wrote for nearly all the major newspapers of Vienna. In 1906, Salten went to Ullstein as an editor in chief of the B.Z. am Mittag and the Berliner Morgenpost, but relocated to Vienna some months later. He wrote also film scripts and librettos for operettas. In 1927 he became president of the Austrian P.E.N. club as successor of Arthur Schnitzler.\nThe most famous work of Salten, who himself was an avid hunter, is Bambi (1923). It was translated into English in 1928 and became a Book-of-the-Month Club success. In 1933, he sold the film rights to the American director Sidney Franklin for only $1,000, and Franklin later transferred the rights to the Walt Disney studios, which formed the basis of the 1942 animated classic, Bambi.\nLife in Austria became perilous for a prominent Jew during the 1930s. In Germany, Adolf Hitler had Salten's books banned in 1936. Two years later, after Germany's annexation of Austria, Salten moved to Zurich, Switzerland, with his wife, and spent his final years there. Felix Salten died on 8 October 1945, at the age of 76. He is buried at Israelitischer Friedhof Unterer Friesenberg.\nSalten married actress Ottilie Metzl (1868\u20131942) in 1902, and had two children: Paul (1903\u20131937) and Anna Katharina (1904\u20131977). He composed another book based on the character Bambi, titled Bambi\u2019s Children: The Story of a Forest Family (1939). His stories Perri and The Hound of Florence inspired the Disney films Perri (1957) and The Shaggy Dog (1959), respectively.\nSalten is now considered to be the anonymous author of a witty, celebrated erotic novel, Josephine Mutzenbacher: The Life Story of a Viennese Whore, as Told by Herself (1906), filled with social criticism.\nSelected works\n1899 \u2013 Der Gemeine\n1906 \u2013 Josephine Mutzenbacher, authorship assumed \u2013 in German: Josefine Mutzenbacher oder Die Geschichte einer Wienerischen Dirne von ihr selbst erz\u00e4hlt (Vienna: Privatdruck [Fritz Freund], 1906)\n1907 \u2013 Herr Wenzel auf Rehberg und sein Knecht Kaspar Dinckel\n1910 \u2013 Olga Frohgemuth\n1911 \u2013 Der Wurstelprater\n1922 \u2013 Das Burgtheater\n1923 \u2013 Der Hund von Florenz; English translation by Huntley Paterson, illustrated by Kurt Wiese, The Hound of Florence (Simon & Schuster, 1930), OCLC\u00a01826868\n1923 \u2013 Bambi: Eine Lebensgeschichte aus dem Walde; English transl.

He influenced Japanese literature in the late Meiji period with his blend of romantic individualism, concepts of self-realization, aesthetics, and nationalism. However, many of Chogy\u016b's works seem cryptic to readers today, due to the archaic style he employed.\n\nEarly life\nChogy\u016b was born in what is now the city of Tsuruoka in Yamagata Prefecture. His father was a minor samurai of the Sh\u014dnai Domain, who found employment with the police after the Meiji Restoration. At the age of two he was adopted by his aunt's family.\nIn 1887 he entered high school in Sendai, where he excelled in English and English literature. While studying philosophy at Tokyo Imperial University, he was influenced by Thomas Hill Green's concepts of self-realization and nationalism.\n\nLiterary career\nChogy\u016b entered and won a fiction contest sponsored by Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper for his semi-historical romance, Takiguchi Ny\u016bd\u014d. It was his first, and only, novel. While still a student, he co-founded the literary journal Teikoku Bungaku (Imperial Literature) and submitted articles to the literary magazine, Taiy\u014d (Sun), of which he later became senior editor. He also changed his official residence to Hokkaid\u014d to avoid military conscription.\nIn 1896, Chogy\u016b returned to Sendai to teach English and logic at a prestigious high school. A student revolt the following year forced him give up teaching to edit a literary magazine, and he returned Tokyo. It was at this time he married Sat\u014d Sugi.\nDuring the surge of ultra-nationalism that enveloped Japan in the wake of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1895 and the Triple Intervention, Chogy\u016b wrote about his identity as a Japanese. Chogy\u016b wrote patriotic articles emphasizing the oneness of the Emperor with his subjects. He also praised the concept of individualism as described in the writings of Walt Whitman. He was also an advocate of Pan-Asianism, asserting that the general trend of western civilization was that of racial nationalism, and that any alliances with Western nations would yield eventually to competition, if not a racial war. However, Chogy\u016b later expressed concern with the militaristic tendencies developing in Japan.\nIn 1898, while a lecturer at Waseda University, Chogy\u016b asserted that the merit of historical paintings was in the beauty of the painting itself, which revealed the idealized beauty, or aesthetics of a historical period. He published Kinsei Bigaku (Modern Aesthetics) in 1899, presenting theories somewhat at odds with Mori \u014cgai's Outline of Aesthetics.\nIn 1900, Ministry of Education selected Chogy\u016b to study in Europe together with Natsume S\u014dseki with a position at Kyoto Imperial University waiting for him on his return, but he developed tuberculosis and declined. During his convalescence, he wrote articles praising Friedrich Nietzsche and on aesthetics. In 1901, Chogy\u016b became a professor at Toyo University. Teaching one day a week, he devoted most of his time to writing. In 1902, he received a doctorate in literature from Tokyo Imperial University, writing about Asuka period art. The work left him exhausted.\nAs sea air was thought to be helpful for lung ailments, Chogy\u016b moved from Tokyo to the seaside resort towns of Atami, Shimizu, Oiso, and finally to Kamakura in an effort to cure his disease. With the likelihood of recovery increasingly remote, he turned his attention the teachings of the 13th-century Buddhist leader Nichiren. He continued to write, but on religious philosophy, especially Nichirenism. However, his condition worsened and he died on 24 December 1902 at a hospital in nearby Chigasaki. He lived in a house within the precincts of Kamakura's Hase-dera during the last year of his life, and his funeral rites were at the temple.\nHis grave is located at Ryuge-ji, a temple in Shimizu, Shizuoka Prefecture. The inscription on the grave is from one of his writings: \"Obviously we should transcend the present.\"\nAlthough Chogy\u016b's literary career spanned a mere six years, he had a major impact on other Japanese writers; he is largely unknown outside Japan.\n\nReferences\nGluck, Carol, Japan's Modern Myths.

He is considered by critics and writers to be one of the most influential authors of the 20th century.\nBackground\nProust was born on 10 July 1871, shortly after the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian war and at the very beginning of the Third Republic. He was born in the Paris Borough of Auteuil (the south-western sector of the then-rustic 16th arrondissement) at the home of his great-uncle on 10 July 1871, two months after the Treaty of Frankfurt formally ended the Franco-Prussian War. His birth took place during the violence that surrounded the suppression of the Paris Commune, and his childhood corresponded with the consolidation of the French Third Republic. Much of In Search of Lost Time concerns the vast changes, most particularly the decline of the aristocracy and the rise of the middle classes, that occurred in France during the Third Republic and the fin de si\u00e8cle.\nProust's father, Adrien Proust, was a prominent pathologist and epidemiologist, studying cholera in Europe and Asia. He wrote numerous articles and books on medicine and hygiene. Proust's mother, Jeanne Cl\u00e9mence (Weil), was the daughter of a wealthy Jewish family from Alsace. Literate and well-read, she demonstrated a well-developed sense of humour in her letters, and her command of English was sufficient to help with her son's translations of John Ruskin. Proust was raised in his father's Catholic faith. He was baptized (on 5 August 1871, at the church of Saint-Louis d'Antin) and later confirmed as a Catholic, but he never formally practised that faith. He later became an atheist and was something of a mystic.By the age of nine, Proust had had his first serious asthma attack, and thereafter he was considered a sickly child. Proust spent long holidays in the village of Illiers. This village, combined with recollections of his great-uncle's house in Auteuil, became the model for the fictional town of Combray, where some of the most important scenes of In Search of Lost Time take place. (Illiers was renamed Illiers-Combray in 1971 on the occasion of the Proust centenary celebrations.)\nIn 1882, at the age of eleven, Proust became a pupil at the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet; however, his education was disrupted by his illness. Despite this, he excelled in literature, receiving an award in his final year. Thanks to his classmates, he was able to gain access to some of the salons of the upper bourgeoisie, providing him with copious material for In Search of Lost Time.\nIn spite of his poor health, Proust served a year (1889\u201390) in the French army, stationed at Coligny Barracks in Orl\u00e9ans, an experience that provided a lengthy episode in The Guermantes' Way, part three of his novel. As a young man, Proust was a dilettante and a social climber whose aspirations as a writer were hampered by his lack of self-discipline. His reputation from this period, as a snob and an amateur, contributed to his later troubles with getting Swann's Way, the first part of his large-scale novel, published in 1913. At this time, he attended the salons of Mme Straus, widow of Georges Bizet and mother of Proust's childhood friend Jacques Bizet, of Madeleine Lemaire and of Mme Arman de Caillavet, one of the models for Madame Verdurin, and mother of his friend Gaston Arman de Caillavet, with whose fianc\u00e9e (Jeanne Pouquet) he was in love. It is through Mme Arman de Caillavet, he made the acquaintance of Anatole France, her lover.\nProust had a close relationship with his mother. To appease his father, who insisted that he pursue a career, Proust obtained a volunteer position at Biblioth\u00e8que Mazarine in the summer of 1896. After exerting considerable effort, he obtained a sick leave that extended for several years until he was considered to have resigned. He never worked at his job, and he did not move from his parents' apartment until after both were dead.His life and family circle changed markedly between 1900 and 1905. In February 1903, Proust's brother, Robert Proust, married and left the family home. His father died in November of the same year. Finally, and most crushingly, Proust's beloved mother died in September 1905. She left him a considerable inheritance. His health throughout this period continued to deteriorate.\nProust spent the last three years of his life mostly confined to his bedroom, sleeping during the day and working at night to complete his novel. He died of pneumonia and a pulmonary abscess in 1922. He was buried in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.\nEarly writing\nProust was involved in writing and publishing from an early age. In addition to the literary magazines with which he was associated, and in which he published while at school (La Revue verte and La Revue lilas), from 1890 to 1891 he published a regular society column in the journal Le Mensuel. In 1892, he was involved in founding a literary review called Le Banquet (also the French title of Plato's Symposium), and throughout the next several years Proust published small pieces regularly in this journal and in the prestigious La Revue Blanche.\nIn 1896 Les plaisirs et les jours, a compendium of many of these early pieces, was published. The book included a foreword by Anatole France, drawings by Mme Lemaire in whose salon Proust was a frequent guest, and who inspired Proust's Mme Verdurin. She invited him and Reynaldo Hahn to her ch\u00e2teau de R\u00e9veillon (the model for Mme Verdurin's La Raspeli\u00e8re) in summer 1894, and for three weeks in 1895. This book was so sumptuously produced that it cost twice the normal price of a book its size.\nThat year Proust also began working on a novel, which was eventually published in 1952 and titled Jean Santeuil by his posthumous editors. Many of the themes later developed in In Search of Lost Time find their first articulation in this unfinished work, including the enigma of memory and the necessity of reflection; several sections of In Search of Lost Time can be read in the first draft in Jean Santeuil. The portrait of the parents in Jean Santeuil is quite harsh, in marked contrast to the adoration with which the parents are painted in Proust's masterpiece. Following the poor reception of Les Plaisirs et les Jours, and internal troubles with resolving the plot, Proust gradually abandoned Jean Santeuil in 1897 and stopped work on it entirely by 1899.\nBeginning in 1895 Proust spent several years reading Thomas Carlyle, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and John Ruskin. Through this reading, he refined his theories of art and the role of the artist in society. Also, in Time Regained Proust's universal protagonist recalls having translated Ruskin's Sesame and Lilies. The artist's responsibility is to confront the appearance of nature, deduce its essence and retell or explain that essence in the work of art. Ruskin's view of artistic production was central to this conception, and Ruskin's work was so important to Proust that he claimed to know \"by heart\" several of Ruskin's books, including The Seven Lamps of Architecture, The Bible of Amiens, and Praeterita.Proust set out to translate two of Ruskin's works into French, but was hampered by an imperfect command of English. To compensate for this he made his translations a group affair: sketched out by his mother, the drafts were first revised by Proust, then by Marie Nordlinger, the English cousin of his friend and sometime lover Reynaldo Hahn, then finally polished by Proust. Questioned about his method by an editor, Proust responded, \"I don't claim to know English; I claim to know Ruskin\". The Bible of Amiens, with Proust's extended introduction, was published in French in 1904. Both the translation and the introduction were well-reviewed; Henri Bergson called Proust's introduction \"an important contribution to the psychology of Ruskin\", and had similar praise for the translation. At the time of this publication, Proust was already translating Ruskin's Sesame and Lilies, which he completed in June 1905, just before his mother's death, and published in 1906. Literary historians and critics have ascertained that, apart from Ruskin, Proust's chief literary influences included Saint-Simon, Montaigne, Stendhal, Flaubert, George Eliot, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Leo Tolstoy.\n1908 was an important year for Proust's development as a writer. During the first part of the year he published in various journals pastiches of other writers. These exercises in imitation may have allowed Proust to solidify his own style. In addition, in the spring and summer of the year Proust began work on several different fragments of writing that would later coalesce under the working title of Contre Sainte-Beuve. Proust described his efforts in a letter to a friend: \"I have in progress: a study on the nobility, a Parisian novel, an essay on Sainte-Beuve and Flaubert, an essay on women, an essay on pederasty (not easy to publish), a study on stained-glass windows, a study on tombstones, a study on the novel\".From these disparate fragments Proust began to shape a novel on which he worked continually during this period. The rough outline of the work centred on a first-person narrator, unable to sleep, who during the night remembers waiting as a child for his mother to come to him in the morning. The novel was to have ended with a critical examination of Sainte-Beuve and a refutation of his theory that biography was the most important tool for understanding an artist's work. Present in the unfinished manuscript notebooks are many elements that correspond to parts of the Recherche, in particular, to the \"Combray\" and \"Swann in Love\" sections of Volume 1, and to the final section of Volume 7. Trouble with finding a publisher, as well as a gradually changing conception of his novel, led Proust to shift work to a substantially different project that still contained many of the same themes and elements. By 1910 he was at work on \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu.\n\nIn Search of Lost Time\nBegun in 1909, when Proust was 38 years old, \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu consists of seven volumes totaling around 3,200 pages (about 4,300 in The Modern Library's translation) and featuring more than 2,000 characters. Graham Greene called Proust the \"greatest novelist of the 20th century\", and W. Somerset Maugham called the novel the \"greatest fiction to date\". Andr\u00e9 Gide was initially not so taken with his work. The first volume was refused by the publisher Gallimard on Gide's advice. He later wrote to Proust apologizing for his part in the refusal and calling it one of the most serious mistakes of his life.Proust died before he was able to complete his revision of the drafts and proofs of the final volumes, the last three of which were published posthumously and edited by his brother Robert.\nThe book was translated into English by C. K. Scott Moncrieff, appearing under the title Remembrance of Things Past between 1922 and 1931. Scott Moncrieff translated volumes one through six of the seven volumes, dying before completing the last. This last volume was rendered by other translators at different times. When Scott Moncrieff's translation was later revised (first by Terence Kilmartin, then by D. J. Enright) the title of the novel was changed to the more literal In Search of Lost Time.\nIn 1995 Penguin undertook a fresh translation of the book by editor Christopher Prendergast and seven translators in three countries, based on the latest, most complete and authoritative French text. Its six volumes, comprising Proust's seven, were published in Britain under the Allen Lane imprint in 2002.\n\nPersonal life\nProust is known to have been homosexual, and his sexuality and relationships with men are often discussed by his biographers. Although his housekeeper, C\u00e9leste Albaret, denies this aspect of Proust's sexuality in her memoirs, her denial runs contrary to the statements of many of Proust's friends and contemporaries, including his fellow writer Andr\u00e9 Gide as well as his valet Ernest A. Forssgren.Proust never openly admitted to his homosexuality, though his family and close friends either knew or suspected it. In 1897, he even fought a duel with writer Jean Lorrain, who publicly questioned the nature of Proust's relationship with Lucien Daudet (both duelists survived). Despite Proust's own public denial, his romantic relationship with composer Reynaldo Hahn, and his infatuation with his chauffeur and secretary, Alfred Agostinelli, are well documented. On the night of 11 January 1918, Proust was one of the men identified by police in a raid on a male brothel run by Albert Le Cuziat. Proust's friend, the poet Paul Morand, openly teased Proust about his visits to male prostitutes. In his journal, Morand refers to Proust, as well as Gide, as \u201cconstantly hunting, never satiated by their adventures \u2026 eternal prowlers, tireless sexual adventurers.\"The exact influence of Proust's sexuality on his writing is a topic of debate. However, In Search of Lost Time discusses homosexuality at length and features several principal characters, both men and women, who are either homosexual or bisexual: the Baron de Charlus, Robert de Saint-Loup, Odette de Cr\u00e9cy, and Albertine Simonet. Homosexuality also appears as a theme in Les plaisirs et les jours and his unfinished novel, Jean Santeuil.\nProust inherited much of his mother's political outlook, which was supportive of the French Third Republic and near the liberal centre of French politics. In an 1892 article published in Le Banquet entitled \"L'Irr\u00e9ligion d'\u00c9tat\", Proust condemned extreme anti-clerical measures such as the expulsion of monks, observing that \"one might just be surprised that the negation of religion should bring in its wake the same fanaticism, intolerance, and persecution as religion itself.\" He argued that socialism posed a greater threat to society than the Church. He was equally critical of the right, lambasting \"the insanity of the conservatives,\" whom he deemed \"as dumb and ungrateful as under Charles X,\" and referring to Pope Pius X's obstinacy as foolish. Proust always rejected the bigoted and illiberal views harbored by many priests at the time, but believed that the most enlightened clerics could be just as progressive as the most enlightened secularists, and that both could serve the cause of \"the advanced liberal Republic\". He approved of the more moderate stance taken in 1906 by Aristide Briand, whom he described as \"admirable\".Proust was among the earliest Dreyfusards, even attending \u00c9mile Zola's trial and proudly claiming to have been the one who asked Anatole France to sign the petition in support of Dreyfus's innocence. In 1919, when representatives of the right-wing Action Fran\u00e7aise published a manifesto upholding French colonialism and the Catholic Church as the embodiment of civilised values, Proust rejected their nationalism and chauvinism in favor of a liberal pluralist vision which acknowledged Christianity's cultural legacy in France. Julien Benda commended Proust in La Trahison des clercs as a writer who distinguished himself from his generation by avoiding the twin traps of nationalism and class sectarianism.\nGallery\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\nNovels\nIn Search of Lost Time (\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu published in seven volumes, previously translated as Remembrance of Things Past) (1913\u20131927)Swann's Way (Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swann, sometimes translated as The Way by Swann's) (1913)\nIn the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower (\u00c0 l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs, also translated as Within a Budding Grove) (1919)\nThe Guermantes Way (Le C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Guermantes originally published in two volumes) (1920\/1921)\nSodom and Gomorrah (Sodome et Gomorrhe originally published in two volumes, sometimes translated as Cities of the Plain) (1921\/1922)\nThe Prisoner (La Prisonni\u00e8re, also translated as The Captive) (1923)\nThe Fugitive (Albertine disparue, also titled La Fugitive, sometimes translated as The Sweet Cheat Gone or Albertine Gone) (1925)\nTime Regained (Le Temps retrouv\u00e9, also translated as Finding Time Again and The Past Recaptured) (1927)Jean Santeuil (unfinished novel in 3 volumes published posthumously \u2013 1952)Short story collections\nEarly Stories (short stories published posthumously)\nPleasures and Days (Les plaisirs et les jours; illustrations by Madeleine Lemaire, preface by Anatole France, and four piano works by Reynaldo Hahn) (1896)Non-fiction\nPastiches, or The Lemoine Affair (Pastiches et m\u00e9langes \u2013 a collection) (1919)\nAgainst Sainte-Beuve (Contre Sainte-Beuve: suivi de Nouveaux m\u00e9langes) (published posthumously 1954)Translations of John Ruskin\nLa Bible d'Amiens (translation of The Bible of Amiens) (1896)\nS\u00e9same et les lys: des tr\u00e9sors des rois, des jardins des reines (translation of Sesame and Lilies) (1906)See also\nAlbertine, a novel based on a character in \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu by Jacqueline Rose London 2001\nC\u00e9leste, a German film dramatising part of Proust's life, seen from the viewpoint of his housekeeper C\u00e9leste Albaret\nInvoluntary memory\nLe Temps Retrouv\u00e9, d'apr\u00e8s l'\u0153uvre de Marcel Proust (Time Regained), film by director Raul Ruiz, 1999\nMme Proust and the Kosher Kitchen, a novel by Kate Taylor that includes a fictional diary written by Proust's mother\n\"Proust\", an essay by Samuel Beckett\nProust Questionnaire\nSwann in Love, film by the director Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff, 1984\nLa captive, film by the director Chantal Akerman, 2000References\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nMarcel Proust at the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\nMarcel Proust at Curlie\nBBC audio file.

He first became known in the 1890s as a dandy and a humorist. He was the drama critic for the Saturday Review from 1898 until 1910, when he relocated to Rapallo, Italy. In his later years he was popular for his occasional radio broadcasts. Among his best-known works is his only novel, Zuleika Dobson, published in 1911. His caricatures, drawn usually in pen or pencil with muted watercolour tinting, are in many public collections.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in 57 Palace Gardens Terrace, London which is now marked with a blue plaque, Henry Maximilian Beerbohm was the youngest of nine children of a Lithuanian-born grain merchant, Julius Ewald Edward Beerbohm (1811\u20131892). His mother was Eliza Draper Beerbohm (c. 1833\u20131918), the sister of Julius's late first wife. Although the Beerbohms were supposed by some to be of Jewish descent, on looking into the question in his later years Beerbohm told a biographer:\n\nI should be delighted to know that we Beerbohms have that very admirable and engaging thing, Jewish blood. But there seems to be no reason for supposing that we have. Our family records go back as far as 1668, and there is nothing in them compatible with Judaism.\nBeerbohm was close to four half-siblings, one of whom, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, was already a renowned stage actor when Max was a child. Other older half-siblings were the author and explorer Julius Beerbohm and the author Constance Beerbohm. His nieces were Viola, Felicity and Iris Tree.\nFrom 1881 to 1885 Max \u2013 he was always called simply \"Max\" and it is thus that he signed his drawings \u2013 attended the day school of a Mr Wilkinson in Orme Square. Wilkinson, Beerbohm later said, \"gave me my love of Latin and thereby enabled me to write English\". Mrs Wilkinson taught drawing to the students, the only lessons Beerbohm ever had in the subject.Beerbohm was educated at Charterhouse School and Merton College, Oxford, from 1890, where he was Secretary of the Myrmidon Club. It was at school that he began writing. While at Oxford Beerbohm became acquainted with Oscar Wilde and his circle through his half-brother, Herbert Beerbohm Tree. In 1893 he met William Rothenstein, who introduced him to Aubrey Beardsley and other members of the literary and artistic circle connected with The Bodley Head. Though he was an unenthusiastic student academically, Beerbohm became a well-known figure in Oxford social circles. He also began submitting articles and caricatures to London publications, which were met enthusiastically. \"I was a modest, good-humored boy\", he recalled. \"It was Oxford that has made me insufferable.\" In March 1893 he submitted an article on Oscar Wilde to the Anglo-American Times under the pen name \"An American\". Later in 1893 his essay \"The Incomparable Beauty of Modern Dress\" was published in the Oxford journal The Spirit Lamp by its editor, Lord Alfred Douglas.By 1894, having developed his personality as a dandy and humorist, and already a rising star in English letters, he left Oxford without a degree. His A Defence of Cosmetics (The Pervasion of Rouge) appeared in the first edition of The Yellow Book in 1894, his friend Aubrey Beardsley being art editor at the time. At this time Wilde said of him, \"The gods have bestowed on Max the gift of perpetual old age.\"In 1895 Beerbohm went to the United States for several months as secretary to his half-brother Herbert Beerbohm Tree's theatrical company. He was fired when he spent far too many hours polishing the business correspondence. There he became engaged to Grace Conover, an American actress in the company, a relationship that lasted several years.\n\nWriter and broadcaster\nOn his return to England Beerbohm published his first book, The Works of Max Beerbohm (1896), a collection of his essays which had first appeared in The Yellow Book. His first piece of fiction, The Happy Hypocrite, was published in volume XI of The Yellow Book in October 1896. Having been interviewed by George Bernard Shaw himself, in 1898 he followed Shaw as drama critic for the Saturday Review, on whose staff he remained until 1910. At that time the Saturday Review was undergoing renewed popularity under its new owner, the writer Frank Harris, who would later become a close friend of Beerbohm's.\nIt was Shaw, in his final Saturday Review piece, who bestowed upon Beerbohm the lasting epithet, \"the Incomparable Max\" when he wrote, \"The younger generation is knocking at the door; and as I open it there steps spritely in the incomparable Max\".In 1904 Beerbohm met the American actress Florence Kahn. In 1910 they married and moved to Rapallo in Italy, partly as an escape from the social demands and the expense of living in London. Here they remained for the rest of their lives except for the duration of World War I and World War II, when they returned to Britain, and occasional trips to England to take part in exhibitions of his drawings.\nBeerbohm and his wife Florence spent the period of the first world war (1914 to 1918) in a cottage belonging to William Rothenstein, next to Rothenstein's own residence Iles Farm, in Far Oakridge, Gloucestershire. The Arts and Crafts architect Norman Jewson remarked on his dapper appearance there: \"At first it amazed me to see him, in the depths of the country, in war time, always perfectly groomed and immaculately dressed as if for a garden party at Buckingham Palace, but as I got to know him better I realised that he just could not do anything else.\"In his years in Rapallo Beerbohm was visited by many of the eminent men and women of his day, including Ezra Pound, who lived nearby, Somerset Maugham, John Gielgud, Laurence Olivier and Truman Capote among others. Beerbohm never learned to speak Italian in the five decades that he lived in Italy.From 1935 onwards, he was an occasional though popular radio broadcaster, talking on cars and carriages and music halls for the BBC. His radio talks were published in 1946 as Mainly on the Air. His wit is shown often enough in his caricatures but his letters contain a carefully blended humour\u2014a gentle admonishing of the excesses of the day\u2014whilst remaining firmly tongue in cheek. His lifelong friend Reginald Turner, who was also an aesthete and a somewhat witty companion, saved many of Beerbohm's letters.\nBeerbohm's best-known works include A Christmas Garland (1912), a parody of literary styles, Seven Men (1919), which includes \"Enoch Soames\", the tale of a poet who makes a deal with the Devil to find out how posterity will remember him, and Zuleika Dobson (1911), a satire of undergraduate life at Oxford. This was his only novel, but was nonetheless very successful.\n\nCaricaturist\nIn the 1890s, while a student at Oxford University, Beerbohm showed great skill at observant figure sketching. His usual style of single-figure caricatures on formalised groupings, drawn in pen or pencil with delicately applied watercolour tinting, was established by 1896 and flourished until about 1930. In contrast to the heavier artistic style of the Punch tradition, he showed a lightness of touch and simplicity of line. Beerbohm's career as a professional caricaturist began when he was twenty: in 1892 The Strand Magazine published thirty-six of his drawings of 'Club Types'. Their publication dealt, Beerbohm said, \"a great, an almost mortal blow to my modesty\". The first public exhibition of his caricatures was as part of a group show at the Fine Art Society in 1896; his first one-man show at the Carfax Gallery in 1901. Explaining his system for caricature, Beerbohm wrote: \"The whole man must be melted down in a crucible and then, from the solution, fashioned anew. Nothing will be lost but no particle will be as it was before.\" He concluded: \"The most perfect caricature is that which, on a small surface, with the simplest means, most accurately exaggerates, to the highest point, the peculiarities of a human being, at his most characteristic moment, in the most beautiful manner.\"Beerbohm was influenced by French cartoonists such as \"Sem\" (Georges Goursat) and \"Caran d'Ache\" (Emmanuel Poir). He was hailed by The Times in 1913 as \"the greatest of English comic artists\", by Bernard Berenson as \"the English Goya\", and by Edmund Wilson as \"the greatest ... portrayer of personalities \u2013 in the history of art\".Usually inept with hands and feet, Beerbohm excelled in heads and with dandified male costume of a period whose elegance became a source of nostalgic inspiration. His collections of caricatures included Caricatures of Twenty-five Gentlemen (1896), The Poets' Corner (1904), Fifty Caricatures (1913) and Rossetti and His Circle (1922). His caricatures were published widely in the fashionable magazines of the time, and his works were exhibited regularly in London at the Carfax Gallery (1901\u201308) and Leicester Galleries (1911\u201357). At his Rapallo home he drew and wrote infrequently and decorated books in his library. These were sold at auction by Sotheby's of London on 12 and 13 December 1960 following the death of his second wife and literary executor Elisabeth Jungmann.His Rapallo caricatures were mostly of late Victorian and Edwardian political, literary and theatrical personalities. The court of Edward VII had a special place as a subject for affectionate ridicule. Many of Beerbohm's later caricatures were of himself.Major collections of Beerbohm's caricatures are in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; the Tate collection; the Victoria and Albert Museum; Charterhouse School; the Clark Library, University of California; and the Lilly Library, Indiana University; depositories of both caricatures and archival material include Merton College, Oxford; the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin; the Robert H. Taylor collection, Princeton University Library; the Houghton Library, Harvard University; and the privately owned Mark Samuels Lasner collection.\nPersonal life\nBeerbohm married the actress Florence Kahn in 1910. There has been speculation that he was a non-active homosexual (Malcolm Muggeridge, who much disliked him, imputed homosexuality to him), that his marriage was never consummated, that he was a \"natural celibate\" or even just asexual. David Cecil wrote that, \"though he showed no moral disapproval of homosexuality, [Beerbohm] was not disposed to it himself; on the contrary he looked upon it as a great misfortune to be avoided if possible.\" Cecil quotes a letter from Beerbohm to Oscar Wilde's friend Robert Ross in which he asks Ross to keep Reggie Turner from the clutches of Lord Alfred Douglas, \"I really think Reg is at a rather crucial point of his career \u2013 and should hate to see him fall an entire victim to the love that dare not tell its name.\" The fact is that not much is known of Beerbohm's private life.\nEvelyn Waugh also speculated that Beerbohm had made a mariage blanc but added: \"Beerbohm remarked of Ruskin that it was surprising he should marry, without knowing he was impotent.\" Waugh also observed, \"the question is of little importance in an artist of Beerbohm's quality.\"There was also some speculation during his lifetime that Beerbohm was Jewish. Muggeridge assumed that Beerbohm's Jewishness was certain. Beerbohm responded by saying that, disappointingly for him, he was not. However, both of his wives were Jews of German stock, although Florence was born and reared in Memphis, Tennessee, in an immigrant family.  She is described as an American. When asked by George Bernard Shaw if he had any Jewish ancestors, Beerbohm replied: \"That my talent is rather like Jewish talent I admit readily... But, being in fact a Gentile, I am, in a small way, rather remarkable, and wish to remain so.\" In his poem Hugh Selwyn Mauberley Ezra Pound, a neighbour in Rapallo \u2013 and later a supporter of fascism and anti-Semitism \u2013 caricatured Beerbohm as \"Brennbaum\", a Jewish artist.\nThe Maximilian Society\nBeerbohm was knighted by George VI in 1939; it was thought that this mark of esteem had been delayed by his mockery in 1911 of the king's parents, about whom he had written a satiric verse, \"Ballade Tragique a Double Refrain\". In August 1942, on the occasion of Beerbohm\u2019s seventieth birthday, the Maximilian Society was created by a London drama critic in his honour. It had seventy distinguished members, including J. B. Priestley, Walter de la Mare, Augustus John, William Rothenstein, Edward Lutyens, Osbert Lancaster, Siegfried Sassoon, Osbert Sitwell, Leonard Woolf, John Betjeman, Kenneth Clark, E. M. Forster, Graham Greene, and Laurence Housman, and planned to add one more member on each of Beerbohm's successive birthdays. In their first meeting a banquet was held to pay homage to the great man, and he was presented with seventy bottles of wine.\nDeath\nHe died at the Villa Chiara, a private hospital in Rapallo, Italy, aged 83, shortly after marrying his former secretary and companion, Elisabeth Jungmann. Beerbohm was cremated in Genoa and his ashes were interred in the crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral, London, on 29 June 1956.\n\nBibliography\nWritten works\nThe Works of Max Beerbohm, with a Bibliography by John Lane (1896)\nA Defence of Cosmetics (1896)\nThe Happy Hypocrite (1897)\nMore (1899)\nYet Again (1909)\nZuleika Dobson; or, An Oxford Love Story (1911)\nA Christmas Garland, Woven by Max Beerbohm (1912)\nSeven Men (1919; enlarged edition as Seven Men and Two Others, 1950)\nHerbert Beerbohm Tree: Some Memories of Him and of His Art (1920, ed.

He was the son of famous Peruvian author and scholar Ricardo Palma and Ecuadorian Clemencia Ram\u00ednez. His halfsister Ang\u00e9lica Palma was also a writer.\nLife\nClemente Palma y Ram\u00edrez was born on December 3, 1872 in Lima, Peru, son of famous Peruvian author Ricardo Palma and Ecuadorian Clemencia Ram\u00edrez. On 1876, his father later married Cristina Rom\u00e1n, which whom he had seven other children: F\u00e9lix Vital, Ang\u00e9lica, Ricardo, Peregrina Augusta, Cristina, Cristi\u00e1n and Ren\u00e9e Cristina.\nIn 1897 he obtained a degree in Letters from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, with a thesis entitled El Porvenir de las Razas en el Per\u00fa (\"The Future of the Races in Peru\") in which he defended the controversial thesis that the Peruvian race had to be improved and that this could be achieved through the introduction of Germans into Peru. He also obtained a doctorate from this university with a thesis on philosophy and art and became a professor at the university subsequently. In 1899 he obtained a bachelor of law degree from the same university. During his university studies, he worked as curator of the National Library of Peru and started his activities as a writer.\nFrom 1902 to 1904 he was the consul of Peru in Barcelona. In Spain he met Maria Manuela Schmalz whom he married in 1902. They had five children: Judith, Clemente Ricardo, Ricardo, Clemencia and Isabel.\nUpon his return to Peru, he resumed his position as curator of the National Library of Peru, a post that he held until November 1911. During this period, he founded several cultural and literary magazines such as Prisma and Variedades and the daily newspaper La Cr\u00f3nica. From 1911 to 1918, he dedicated himself to the direction of these magazines. He was director of the magazines Prisma (1906\u20131908) and Variedades (1908\u20131931) and the newspaper La Cr\u00f3nica (1912\u20131929).\nBetween 1919 and 1930, Clemente Palma was a Member of Parliament, supporting the authoritarian President Augusto B. Leguia, who had taken power through a coup. During this period, he remained active in the press and also taught classes of aesthetics and art history at his alma mater. In 1930, he was imprisoned for a while after the coup of Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro. He was liberated thanks to the pressure of his friends but was forced into exile to Chile in 1932. He could return to Peru only after the assassination of Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro in 1933. During his exile in Chile, he wrote the science fiction novel XYZ.\nAfter the publication of this novel, he mainly wrote literary criticism and essays.\n\nWorks\nClemente Palma was an important literary critic in Peru and exercised an important influence through the magazine Variedades. In that role, he has been criticized for not recognising the genius of C\u00e9sar Vallejo when the latter sent him one of his early poems for review.\nPalma's best known works are in the realm of fiction. He is one of the first adherents of modernism in Peru. He made a great contribution to the development of the short story and science fiction in Peru and introduced new themes in its literature. His stories deal mostly with fantastic themes, psychological horror and science fiction. He was attracted to the morbid and many of his characters are abnormal and perverse.\nAs his father was the director of the National Library of Peru, he had the opportunity to read the works of many foreign authors. His work shows a strong influence of Edgar Allan Poe and, to a lesser extent, nineteenth-century Russian writers and symbolist and decadent French writers, as well as the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. His two short story collections Cuentos mal\u00e9volos (\"Malevolent Tales\") (1904) and Historietas Malignas (\"Malignant Tales\") (1925) are in the style of Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's Contes cruels. Influenced by decadent themes and subject matter, they are filled with dark humor, blasphemy and the supernatural. His Tres cuentos Verdes (1922) were in the style of his father's Tradiciones en Salsa Verde. He also wrote several novels, including Mors et Vita (\"Death and Life\") (1923) and XYZ (1934). This last novel has some similarities with the science fiction novel The Invention of Morel published by the Argentine Adolfo Bioy Casares in 1940.\nThe Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa (PUCP) re-edited the entire narrative work of Clemente Palma, including the novel \"XYZ\", in 2006.\nHis major works are: \n\n\"Excursi\u00f3n literaria\" (1895)\n\"Filosof\u00eda y arte\" (1897)\n\"El porvenir de las razas\" (1897),\n\"El Per\u00fa\" (1898)\n\"Cuentos Mal\u00e9volos\" (1904)\n\"Historietas Malignas\" (1925)\n\"La cuesti\u00f3n de Tacna y Arica y la conferencia de Washington\" (1922)\n\"Tres cuentos Verdes\" (1922)\n\"Mors ex vita\" (1923), novel.\n\"XYZ\" (1934)\n\"Hab\u00eda una vez un hombre...\" (1935)\n\"Don Alonso Henr\u00edquez de Guzm\u00e1n y el primer poema sobre la conquista de Am\u00e9rica!

As a political radical in the 1890s, he moved steadily to the right. In literature he attempted to define the eternal qualities of Spanish life. His essays and criticism are written in a simple, compact style. Particularly notable are his impressionistic descriptions of Castilian towns and landscape.\n\nEarly life and education\nJos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz was born in the village of Mon\u00f2ver, Spain in the province of Alicante on 8 June 1873. He was the oldest of nine children and enjoyed reading in his youth. His father, a middle-class lawyer, was an active conservative politician and later became a representative and mayor, and a follower of Romero Robledo. His mother, a landowner, was born in nearby Petrel. From the age of eight, until he was 16, he attended a boarding school run by the Escolapius Fathers (Piarists) in his father's home town of Yecla in the province of Murcia. \nFrom 1888 to 1896 he studied law at the University of Valencia, but did not complete his studies. Thereafter he began to write, publishing a monograph on literary criticism in 1893. Here he began to write for local newspapers, contributing articles to the radical journal El pueblo, edited by Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. He became interested in the ideas of Karl Krause, who argued that man could be reformed through education, and that openness to other nation's cultures could overcome national conservatism.\nIn 1895, Ruiz published Anarquistas literarios and Notas sociales, in which he presented the main anarchist theories of the time. During this time he was a political radical. Ruiz became an admirer of the liberal Prime Minister Antonio Maura, who fought the culture of \"caciques\" (local political bosses), and who had become the figurehead of a youth movement, the Mauristas, who wanted him as a new head of state of Spain at a time of substantial resentment of King Alfonso XIII.\n\nCareer, writing and political evolution\nRuiz\u2019s journalism developed on moving to Madrid in 1896. He wrote for the republican newspaper El Pa\u00eds until he was dismissed for his radicalism in February 1897. He also wrote for the Paris-based anarchist magazine La Campa\u00f1a, and other Spanish journals including El Progreso (\"Progress\"), and El Imparcial (\"The impartial\"). His output during this period displayed anti-establishment views, including anarchist ideas, seeing writing as a catalyst for change, and depreciating aesthetics and faith.\nHowever, by 1899 his outlook was beginning to change. His work began to display a new philosophical and artistic consciousness, and an interest in the past. His book El alma castellana (The Castilian Soul), and his essay collections, La ruta de Don Quijote (The Route of Don Quixote) and, much later, Una hora de Espa\u00f1a 1560\u20131590 (Spain's Hour, 1560\u20131590) capture the essence of being Spanish.  He was abandoning revolutionary ideas, but becoming more nihilist, though respecting the dignity of human beings, and using irony to stand at arm's length from the world. This pessimism would eventually lead him to a period of political conservatism\n\nIn 1902 he published the first of three intensely biographical novels, La voluntad (Volition), followed by Antonio Azor\u00edn, and Las confesiones de un peque\u00f1o fil\u00f3sofo (The Confessions of a Minor Philosopher). Early in his career, Ruiz had used pen names, such as C\u00e1ndido (in honor of Voltaire) and Ahrim\u00e1n (the Persian god of destruction), and in 1904 he discarded his own name and began to use the surname of one of his characters, \"Azor\u00edn\". Using mostly short sentences, in both his fiction and his essays he emphasized the small but enduring elements and events in history and in one's life. In his view, time consisted of a series of repetitions, a notion of time described as \"timeless\". He married Julia Guinda Urzanqui in 1908; she was to remain beside him for the rest of life and outlive him. She died in 1974 aged 98. They had no children. By 1913 he was writing for ABC, the popular pro-monarchy, conservative newspaper, including a series of articles on \u201cLa generaci\u00f3n de 1898\u201d (Generation of 98), a literary and artistic group to which he belonged.\nRuiz served as a conservative deputy in the Cortes Generales  from 1907 to 1919, eventually becoming an under-secretary for the Ministry of Public Instruction. He gave up politics in opposition to the dictatorship of Gen. Primo de Rivera, though he never opposed him publicly. He had by now become noted as a drama critic and essayist. His literary criticism, such as Al margen de los cl\u00e1sicos (Marginal Notes to the Classics), Don Juan and Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s, helped to open up new avenues of literary taste and to arouse a new enthusiasm for the Spanish classics at a time when a large portion of Spanish literature was virtually unavailable to the public.  In 1924, he was elected to the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola. His first of a dozen plays, Old Spain, appeared in 1926, followed by Brandy mucho brandy and La comedia del arte, but had difficulty in adapting his slow and meticulous style to the dynamics and rhythm of drama. A wry comedy about journalists increasing newspaper sales by inventing stories, El Clamor (The Cry), led to the leadership of the Asociaci\u00f3n de la Prensa expelling him, an act which Azor\u00edn likened to that of the Inquisition. He began to be influenced by the avant-garde movement, experimenting in a personal version of surrealism in a short trilogy, Lo invisible (The Invisible).\nThe outbreak of the Republic saw him re-adopt his old progressive political ideals. He abandoned ABC to write for the republican newspapers El Sol, La Libertad and Ahora). He edited Revista de Occidente, founded by Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset, a journal promoting European philosophy, from 1923 to 1936. At the outset of the Spanish Civil War, in 1936, Azor\u00edn fled to Paris, where he continued his literary career writing for the Argentine newspaper La Naci\u00f3n. A book reflecting on this period of exile, Espa\u00f1oles en Par\u00eds, was published in 1939.\nWhen he returned to Spain on 23 August 1939, he found himself in \"inner exile\", along with other intellectuals who had not overtly supported the Franco regime during the conflict. He was at first denied a press identification card (tarjeta de periodista), but was supported by Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er, at that time Franco's Interior Minister and president of the Falange. Accepting Franco\u2019s regime was the price he had to pay in order to be admitted back, and he aligned with the dictatorship in a noted article in the right-wing journal V\u00e9rtice. He contributed again to ABC from 1941 to 1962. He published numerous new works which were redolent of his earlier literary successes, including Pensando en Espa\u00f1a and Sintiendo Espa\u00f1a.\n\nLater life\nIn his old age, Azor\u00edn became a film enthusiast, writing numerous articles, some of which are reprinted in El cine y el momento, and claiming that \"Cinema is the greatest form of art\". He died in Madrid, Spain on March 2, 1967, at the age of 93.The political evolution that transformed Ruiz, a committed journalist as well as a revolutionary anarchist, into Azor\u00edn, a conservative member of parliament, as well as a sceptic and indulgent writer intimidated by Franco's regime, is key to understanding the division of his critics. Two different images of him were sustained, successive and irreconcilable personalities that cannot be studied at the same time without understanding the contradictions.\nHonors\n1917, Hijo Predilecto de Mon\u00f2ver.\n1924, Elected to the Royal Spanish Academy\n1946, Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic\n1956, Grand Cross of the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise.\n1969, His home in Mon\u00f2ver established as a museum, Casa-Museo Azor\u00ednPublications\nSee also\nList of essayists\nList of Spanish writers\nList of Spanish-language authorsReferences\nFurther reading\nS\u00e1enz, Paz, ed.

The Good Soldier is frequently included among the great literature of the 20th century, including the Modern Library 100 Best Novels, The Observer\u2032s \"100 Greatest Novels of All Time\", and The Guardian\u2032s \"1000 novels everyone must read\".\n\nEarly life\nFord was born in Wimbledon in London, to Catherine Madox Brown and Francis Hueffer, the eldest of three; his brother was Oliver Madox Hueffer and his sister was Juliet Catherine Emma Hueffer, the wife of David Soskice and mother of Frank Soskice. Ford's father, who became music critic for The Times, was German and his mother English. His paternal grandfather Johann Hermann H\u00fcffer was first to publish Westphalian poet and author Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoff. He was named after his maternal grandfather, the Pre-Raphaelite painter Ford Madox Brown, whose biography he would eventually write. His mother's older half-sister was Lucy Madox Brown, the wife of William Michael Rossetti and mother of Olivia Rossetti Agresti.   \nIn 1889, after the death of his father, Ford and Oliver went to live with their grandfather in London.  Ford graduated from the University College School in London, but never attended university.\nPersonal life\nIn 1894, Ford eloped with his school girlfriend Elsie Martindale.  The couple were married in Gloucester and moved to Bonnington.  In 1901, they moved to Winchelsea. They had two daughters, Christina (born 1897) and Katharine (born 1900). Ford's neighbours in Winchelsea included the authors Henry James and H.G. Wells.In 1904, Ford suffered an agoraphobic breakdown due to financial and marital problems. He went to Germany to spend time with family there and undergo cure treatments.In 1909, Ford left his wife and set up home with English writer Isobel Violet Hunt, with whom he published the literary magazine The English Review. Ford's wife refused to divorce him and he attempted to become a German citizen in order to obtain a divorce in Germany.  This was unsuccessful.  A reference in an illustrated paper to Violet Hunt as \"Mrs Ford Madox Hueffer\" gave rise to a successful libel action being brought by Mrs Ford in 1913. Ford's relationship with Hunt did not survive the First World War.Ford used the name of Ford Madox Hueffer, but he changed it to Ford Madox Ford after World War I in 1919 because \"Hueffer\" sounded too Germanic.\nBetween 1918 and 1927, he lived with Stella Bowen, an Australian artist 20 years his junior. In 1920, Ford and Bowen had a daughter, Julia Madox Ford.In the summer of 1927, The New York Times reported that Ford had converted a mill building in Avignon, France into a home and workshop that he called \"Le Vieux Moulin\".  The article implied that Ford was reunited with his wife at this point.In the early 1930s Ford established a relationship with Janice Biala, a Polish-born artist from New York, who illustrated several of Ford's later books.  This relationship lasted until the late 1930s.\nFord spent the last years of his life teaching at Olivet College in Olivet, Michigan.  He was taken ill in Honfleur, France in June 1939 and died shortly afterwards in Deauville at the age of 65.\n\nLiterary life\nOne of Ford's most famous works is the novel The Good Soldier (1915). Set just before World War I, The Good Soldier chronicles the tragic expatriate lives of two \"perfect couples\", one British and one American, using intricate flashbacks. In the \"Dedicatory Letter to Stella Ford\u201d that prefaces the novel, Ford reports that a friend pronounced The Good Soldier \u201cthe finest French novel in the English language!\u201d Ford pronounced himself a \"Tory mad about historic continuity\" and believed the novelist's function was to serve as the historian of his own time. However, he was dismissive of the Conservative Party, referring to it as \"the Stupid Party.\"Ford was involved in British war propaganda after the beginning of World War I. He worked for the War Propaganda Bureau, managed by C. F. G. Masterman, along with Arnold Bennett, G. K. Chesterton, John Galsworthy, Hilaire Belloc and Gilbert Murray. Ford wrote two propaganda books for Masterman; When Blood is Their Argument: An Analysis of Prussian Culture (1915), with the help of Richard Aldington, and Between St Dennis and St George: A Sketch of Three Civilizations (1915).\nAfter writing the two propaganda books, Ford enlisted at 41 years of age into the Welch Regiment of the British Army on 30 July 1915. He was sent to France.  Ford's combat experiences and his previous propaganda activities inspired his tetralogy Parade's End (1924\u20131928), set in England and on the Western Front before, during and after World War I.\n\nFord wrote dozens of novels as well as essays, poetry, memoirs and literary criticism.  He collaborated with Joseph Conrad on three novels, The Inheritors (1901), Romance (1903) and The Nature of a Crime (1924, although written much earlier). During the three to five years after this direct collaboration, Ford's best known achievement was The Fifth Queen trilogy (1906\u20131908), historical novels based on the life of Catherine Howard, which Conrad termed, at the time, \"the swan song of historical romance.\"\nFord's poem Antwerp (1915) was praised by T.S. Eliot as \"the only good poem I have met with on the subject of the war\".Ford's novel Ladies Whose Bright Eyes (1911, extensively revised in 1935) is, in a sense, the reverse of Twain's novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.\nWhen the Spanish Civil War broke out, Ford took the side of the left Republican faction, declaring: \"I am unhesitatingly for the existing Spanish Government and against Franco\u2019s attempt\u2014on every ground of feeling and reason...Mr Franco wishes to establish a government resting on the arms of Moors, Germans, Italians. Its success must be contrary to world conscience.\" His opinion of Mussolini and Hitler was likewise negative, and he offered to sign a manifesto against Nazism.\nPromotion of literature\nIn 1908, Ford founded The English Review.  Ford published works by Thomas Hardy, H. G. Wells, Joseph Conrad, Henry James, May Sinclair, John Galsworthy and William Butler Yeats; and debuted works of Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis, D. H. Lawrence and Norman Douglas. Ezra Pound and other Modernist poets in London in the teens particularly valued Ford's poetry as exemplifying treatment of modern subjects in contemporary diction.  In 1924, he founded The Transatlantic Review, a journal with great influence on modern literature. Staying with the artistic community in the Latin Quarter of Paris, Ford befriended James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound and Jean Rhys, all of whom he would publish (Ford was the model for the character Braddocks in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises).  Basil Bunting worked as Ford's assistant on the magazine.\nAs a critic, Ford is known for remarking \"Open the book to page ninety-nine and read, and the quality of the whole will be revealed to you.\" George Seldes, in his book Witness to a Century, describes Ford (\"probably in 1932\") recalling his writing collaboration with Joseph Conrad, and the lack of acknowledgment by publishers of his status as co-author. Seldes recounts Ford's disappointment with Hemingway: \"'and he disowns me now that he has become better known than I am.' Tears now came to Ford's eyes.\" Ford says, \"I helped Joseph Conrad, I helped Hemingway. I helped a dozen, a score of writers, and many of them have beaten me. I'm now an old man and I'll die without making a name like Hemingway.\" Seldes observes, \"At this climax Ford began to sob. Then he began to cry.\"Hemingway devoted a chapter of his Parisian memoir A Moveable Feast to an encounter with Ford at a caf\u00e9 in Paris during the early 1920s.  He describes Ford  \"as upright as an ambulatory, well clothed, up-ended hogshead.\"During a later sojourn in the United States, Ford was involved with Allen Tate, Caroline Gordon, Katherine Anne Porter and Robert Lowell (who was then a student). Ford was always a champion of new literature and literary experimentation. In 1929, he published The English Novel: From the Earliest Days to the Death of Joseph Conrad, a brisk and accessible overview of the history of English novels. He had an affair with Jean Rhys, which ended acrimoniously,which Rhys fictionalised in her novel Quartet.\n\nReception\nFord is best remembered for his novels The Good Soldier (1915), the Parade's End tetralogy (1924\u20131928) and The Fifth Queen trilogy (1906\u20131908). The Good Soldier is frequently included among the great literature of the 20th century, including the Modern Library 100 Best Novels, The Observer\u2032s \"100 Greatest Novels of All Time\", and The Guardian\u2032s \"1000 novels everyone must read\".Anthony Burgess described Ford as the \"greatest British novelist\" of the 20th century.\nSelected works\nThe Shifting of the Fire, as H Ford Hueffer, Unwin, 1892.\nThe Brown Owl, as H Ford Hueffer, Unwin, 1892.\nThe Queen Who Flew: A Fairy Tale, Bliss Sands & Foster, 1894.\nFord Madox Brown\u00a0: a record of his life and work, as H Ford Hueffer, Longmans, Green, 1896.\nThe Cinque Ports, Blackwood, 1900.\nThe Inheritors: An Extravagant Story, Joseph Conrad and Ford M.

He was among the most popular writers of his era and reputedly the highest-paid author during the 1930s.Both Maugham's parents died before he was 10, and the orphaned boy was raised by a paternal uncle, who was emotionally cold. He did not want to become a lawyer like other men in his family, so he trained and qualified as a physician. His first novel Liza of Lambeth (1897) sold out so rapidly that Maugham gave up medicine to write full-time.\nDuring the First World War, he served with the Red Cross and in the ambulance corps before being recruited in 1916 into the British Secret Intelligence Service. He worked for the service in Switzerland and Russia before the October Revolution of 1917 in the Russian Empire. During and after the war, he travelled in India, Southeast Asia and the Pacific. He drew from those experiences in his later short stories and novels.\n\nChildhood and education\nMaugham was the fourth of six sons born in his family. Their father, Robert Ormond Maugham, was a lawyer and handled the legal affairs of the British Embassy in Paris. Since French law declared that all children born on French soil could be conscripted for military service, his father arranged for Maugham to be born at the embassy, diplomatically considered British soil. His grandfather, another Robert, was a prominent lawyer and co-founder of the Law Society of England and Wales. Maugham refers to this grandfather's writings in chapter\u00a06 of his literary memoir The Summing Up:\n\n...in the catalogue of the Library at the British Museum there is a long list of his legal works.  He wrote only one book that was not of this character.  It was a collection of essays that he had contributed to the solid magazines of the day and he issued it, as became his sense of decorum, anonymously. I once had the book in my hands, a handsome volume bound in calf, but I never read it and I have not been able to get hold of a copy since.  I wish I had, for I might have learnt from it something of the kind of man he was.\n\n\nHis family assumed that Maugham and his brothers would be lawyers. His elder brother, Viscount Maugham, did become a lawyer, enjoying a distinguished legal career and serving as Lord Chancellor from 1938 to 1939.\nMaugham's mother, Edith Mary (n\u00e9e Snell), contracted tuberculosis, a condition for which her physician prescribed childbirth. She had Maugham several years after the last of his three elder brothers was born. By the time Maugham was three, his older brothers were all away at boarding school.\nEdith's sixth and final son died on 25 January 1882, one day after his birth. It was Maugham's eighth birthday. Edith died of tuberculosis six days later on 31 January at the age of 41. The early death of his mother left Maugham traumatized. He kept his mother's photograph at his bedside for the rest of his life. Two years after Edith's death, Maugham's father died in France of cancer.\nMaugham was sent back to the UK to be cared for by his paternal uncle Henry MacDonald Maugham, the Vicar of Whitstable, in Kent. The move was emotionally damaging, as Henry Maugham was cold and emotionally cruel. The boy attended The King's School, Canterbury, which was also difficult for him. He was teased for his bad English (French had been his first language) and his short stature, which he inherited from his father. Maugham developed a stammer that stayed with him all his life. It was sporadic, being subject to his moods and circumstances. Miserable both at his uncle's vicarage and at school, the young Maugham developed a talent for making wounding remarks to those who displeased him. This ability is sometimes reflected in Maugham's literary characters.\nAt age 16, Maugham refused to continue at The King's School. His uncle allowed him to travel to Germany, where he studied literature, philosophy and German at Heidelberg University. During his year in Heidelberg, Maugham met and had a sexual affair with John Ellingham Brooks, an Englishman ten years his senior. He also wrote his first book there, a biography of Giacomo Meyerbeer, an opera composer.After Maugham's return to Britain, his uncle found him a position in an accountant's office. After a month Maugham gave it up and returned to Whitstable. His uncle tried to find Maugham a new profession. Maugham's father and three older brothers were distinguished lawyers, but Maugham was not interested in this profession. He rejected a career in the Church because of his stutter. His uncle rejected the Civil Service, believing that it was no longer a career for gentlemen after a new law requiring applicants to pass an entrance examination. The local physician suggested the medical profession, and Maugham's uncle agreed.\nMaugham had been writing steadily since he was 15 and wanted to be an author, but he did not tell his guardian. For the next five years, he studied medicine at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School in Lambeth.\n\nCareer\nEarly works\nMaugham was living in London, meeting people of a \"low\" sort, whom he would never have met otherwise, and seeing them at a time of heightened anxiety and meaning in their lives. In maturity, he recalled the value of his experience as a medical student: \"I saw how men died. I saw how they bore pain. I saw what hope looked like, fear and relief...\"Maugham kept his own lodgings, took pleasure in furnishing them, filled many notebooks with literary ideas, and continued writing nightly, while at the same time studying for his medical degree. In 1897, he published his first novel, Liza of Lambeth, a tale of working-class adultery and its consequences. It drew its details from Maugham's experiences as a medical student doing midwifery work in Lambeth, a South London slum. Maugham wrote near the opening of the novel: \"...\u00a0it is impossible always to give the exact unexpurgated words of Liza and the other personages of the story; the reader is therefore entreated with his thoughts to piece out the necessary imperfections of the dialogue\".Liza of Lambeth's first print run sold out in a matter of weeks. Maugham, who had qualified as a medic, dropped medicine and embarked on his 65-year career as a man of letters. He later said: \"I took to it as a duck takes to water.\"The writer's life allowed Maugham to travel and to live in places such as Spain and Capri for the next decade, but his next ten works never came close to rivalling the success of Liza. This changed in 1907 with the success of his play Lady Frederick. By the next year, he had four plays running simultaneously in London, and Punch published a cartoon of Shakespeare biting his fingernails nervously as he looked at the billboards.\nMaugham's supernatural thriller The Magician (1908) based its principal character on the well-known and somewhat disreputable Aleister Crowley. Crowley took some offence at the treatment of the protagonist, Oliver Haddo. He wrote a critique of the novel, charging Maugham with plagiarism, in a review published in Vanity Fair. Maugham survived the criticism without much damage to his reputation.\n\nPopular success, 1914\u20131939\nBy 1914, Maugham was famous, with 10 plays produced and 10 novels published. Too old to enlist when the First World War broke out, he served in France as a member of the British Red Cross's so-called \"Literary Ambulance Drivers\", a group of 24 well-known writers, including the Americans John Dos Passos, E. E. Cummings, and Ernest Hemingway.\n\nDuring this time he met Frederick Gerald Haxton, a young San Franciscan, who became his companion and lover until Haxton's death in 1944. Throughout this period, Maugham continued to write. He proofread Of Human Bondage at a location near Dunkirk during a lull in his ambulance duties.Of Human Bondage (1915) initially was criticized in both England and the United States; the New York World described the romantic obsession of the protagonist Philip Carey as \"the sentimental servitude of a poor fool\". The influential American novelist and critic Theodore Dreiser rescued the novel, referring to it as a work of genius and comparing it to a Beethoven symphony. His review gave the book a lift, and it has never been out of print since.Maugham indicates in his foreword that he derived the title from a passage in Baruch Spinoza's Ethics:\n\nThe impotence of man to govern or restrain the emotions I call bondage, for a man who is under their control is not his own master\u00a0... so that he is often forced to follow the worse, although he see the better before him.\n\n\nOf Human Bondage is considered to have many autobiographical elements. Maugham gave Philip Carey a club foot (rather than his stammer); the vicar of Blackstable appears derived from the vicar of Whitstable; and Carey is a medic. Maugham insisted that the book was more invention than fact. The close relationship between fictional and non-fictional became Maugham's trademark. He wrote in 1938: \"Fact and fiction are so intermingled in my work that now, looking back on it, I can hardly distinguish one from the other.\"\nMarriage and family\nMaugham entered into a relationship with Syrie Wellcome, the wife of Henry Wellcome, an American-born English pharmaceutical magnate. They had a daughter named Mary Elizabeth (1915\u20131998). Henry Wellcome sued his wife for divorce, naming Maugham as co-respondent.In May 1917, following the decree absolute, Syrie Wellcome and Maugham were married. Syrie Maugham became a noted interior decorator, who in the 1920s popularized \"the all-white room\". They changed their daughter's surname, originally registered as Wellcome and reflecting Syrie's marriage. She was familiarly called Liza, and her surname was changed to Maugham.\nThe marriage was unhappy, and the couple separated. Maugham later lived in the French Riviera with his partner Gerald Haxton until Haxton's death in 1944. He next lived with Alan Searle until his own death in 1965.\nSexuality\nMaugham has been described both as bisexual\nand as homosexual. In addition to his 13-year marriage to Syrie Wellcome, he had affairs with other women in his youth.In later life Maugham was exclusively homosexual and lived successively with two men. Frequently quoted in this connection is Maugham's statement to his nephew Robin:\n\n\nI tried to persuade myself that I was three-quarters normal and that only a quarter of me was queer\u2014whereas really it was the other way around.\n\n\nReligious views\nMaugham said that he remained agnostic to the questions concerning the existence of God. He considered that the misery and bitterness of the world suggested that God did not exist. He said that \"the evidence adduced to prove the truth of one religion is of very much the same sort as that adduced to prove the truth of another\".Maugham did not believe in God or an afterlife. He considered notions of future punishment or reward to be outrageous.\nIntelligence work\nMaugham returned to Britain from his ambulance unit duties in order to promote Of Human Bondage. With that completed, he was eager to assist the war effort again. As he was unable to return to his ambulance unit, Syrie arranged for him to be introduced to a high-ranking intelligence officer known as \"R\"; he was recruited by John Wallinger. In September 1915, Maugham began work in Switzerland, as one of the network of British agents who operated against the Berlin Committee, whose members included Virendranath Chattopadhyay, an Indian revolutionary trying to resist colonial Britain's rule of India. Maugham lived in Switzerland as a writer.\nIn June 1917, Maugham was asked by Sir William Wiseman, an officer of the British Secret Intelligence Service (later named MI6), to undertake a special mission in Russia. It was part of an attempt to keep the Provisional Government in power and Russia in the war, by countering German pacifist propaganda. Two and a half months later, the Bolsheviks took control. Maugham subsequently said that if he had been able to get there six months earlier, he might have succeeded. Quiet and observant, Maugham had a good temperament for intelligence work; he believed that he had inherited from his lawyer father a gift for cool judgment and the ability to avoid being deceived by facile appearances.Maugham used his spying experiences as the basis for Ashenden: Or the British Agent, a collection of short stories about a gentlemanly, sophisticated, aloof spy. This character is considered to have influenced Ian Fleming's later series of James Bond novels. In 1922, Maugham dedicated his book On A Chinese Screen to Syrie. This was a collection of 58 ultra-short story sketches, which he had written during his 1920 travels through China and Hong Kong, intending to expand the sketches later as a book.\nTravels and writing\nIn 1916, Maugham travelled to the Pacific to research his novel The Moon and Sixpence, based on the life of Paul Gauguin. This was the first of his journeys through the late-Imperial world of the 1920s and 1930s that inspired his novels. He became known as a writer who portrayed the last days of European colonialism in India, Southeast Asia, China and the Pacific, although the books on which this reputation rests represent only a fraction of his output. On this and all subsequent journeys, he was accompanied by Haxton, whom he regarded as indispensable to his success as a writer. Maugham was painfully shy, and Haxton the extrovert gathered human material which the author drew from for his fiction. In 1938, he visited the Hindu sage Ramana Maharishi at his ashram in India, after whom he modeled the spiritual guru of his 1944 novel The Razor's Edge.Maugham's play The Letter, starring Gladys Cooper, had its premiere in London in 1927. Later, he asked that Katharine Cornell play the lead in the 1927 Broadway version. He had adapted it for the stage from a story published in 1924 in Hearst's International; it was reprinted in his collection The Casuarina Tree (1926).\nThe play was adapted as a film by the same name in 1929. Jeanne Eagels had the lead. A second film adaptation was released in 1940, starring American actress Bette Davis, who was nominated for an Oscar as Best Actress for her performance. In 1951, Katherine Cornell was a great success playing the lead in Maugham's comedy The Constant Wife.In 1926, Maugham bought the Villa La Mauresque, on 9\u00a0acres (3.6\u00a0hectares) at Cap Ferrat on the French Riviera. It was his home for most of the rest of his life. There he hosted one of the great literary and social salons of the 1920s and 1930s. He continued to be highly productive, writing plays, short stories, novels, essays and travel books. By 1940, when the collapse of France and its occupation by the German Third Reich forced Maugham to leave the French Riviera, he was a refugee\u2014but one of the wealthiest and most famous writers in the English-speaking world.Maugham's short fable An Appointment in Samarra (1933) is based on an ancient Babylonian myth: Death is both the narrator and a central character. The American writer John O'Hara credited Maugham's tale as the inspiration for the title of his novel Appointment in Samarra.\n\nGrand old man of letters\nIn his sixties, Maugham lived for most of the Second World War in the United States, first in Los Angeles, where he worked on many screenplays, and was one of the first authors to make significant money from film adaptations. He later lived in the South. While in the US before that country's entry into the war, he was asked by the British government to make patriotic speeches to induce the US to aid Britain, if not necessarily become an allied combatant. After his companion Gerald Haxton died in 1944, Maugham returned to England. In private, Maugham espoused antisemitic conspiracy theories about Jewish refugees, noting that \"the Gestapo is known to have had spies among refugees, and these have not seldom been Jews\". After the war, in 1946 Maugham returned to his villa in France. He lived there until his death, with time away for frequent and long travels.\nIn that period, Maugham began a relationship with Alan Searle, whom he had first met in 1928. A younger man from the London slum area of Bermondsey, Searle had previously embarked upon an affair with the writer Lytton Strachey. He proved a devoted (if not a stimulating) companion. He was a jocular character, always engaging but could be mischievous. One of Maugham's friends, describing the difference between Haxton and Searle, said simply: \"Gerald was vintage, Alan was vin ordinaire.\"Maugham's love life was almost never smooth. He once confessed: \"I have most loved people who cared little or nothing for me and when people have loved me I have been embarrassed\u00a0... In order not to hurt their feelings, I have often acted a passion I did not feel.\"In 1962 Maugham sold a collection of paintings, some of which had already been assigned by deed to his daughter Liza. She sued her father and won a judgment of \u00a3230,000. Maugham publicly disowned her; by that time his mental health had deteriorated and been brought into question by his family. In order to break all ties, he claimed that Liza was not his biological daughter, and he adopted Searle as his son and heir, but the adoption was annulled. In his 1962 volume of memoirs Looking Back, he attacked the late Syrie Maugham and wrote that Liza had been born before they married. The memoir cost him several friends and exposed him to much public ridicule. Liza and her husband Lord Glendevon contested the change in Maugham's will in the French courts, and it was overturned.\nBut after Maugham's death, in 1965 Searle inherited \u00a350,000, the contents of the Villa La Mauresque, Maugham's manuscripts, and his revenue from copyrights for 30 years. Thereafter the copyrights passed to the Royal Literary Fund.\nThere is no grave for Maugham. His ashes were scattered near the Maugham Library, The King's School, Canterbury. Liza Maugham, Lady Glendevon, died aged 83 in 1998, survived by her four children (a son and a daughter by her first marriage to Vincent Paravicini, and two more sons to Lord Glendevon). Among her grandchildren is Derek Paravicini, who is a musical prodigy and autistic savant.\nAchievements\nCommercial success with high book sales, successful theatre productions and a string of film adaptations, backed by astute stock market investments, allowed Maugham to live a very comfortable life. Small and weak as a boy, Maugham had been proud even then of his stamina, and as an adult he kept churning out the books, proud that he could. Yet, despite his triumphs, he never attracted the highest respect from the critics or his peers. Maugham attributed this to his lack of \"lyrical quality\", his small vocabulary, and failure to make expert use of metaphor in his work. In 1934 the American journalist and radio personality Alexander Woollcott offered Maugham some language advice: \"The female implies, and from that the male infers.\" Maugham responded: \"I am not yet too old to learn.\"Maugham wrote at a time when experimental modernist literature such as that of William Faulkner, Thomas Mann, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf was gaining increasing popularity and winning critical acclaim. In this context, his plain prose style was criticised as \"such a tissue of clich\u00e9s that one's wonder is finally aroused at the writer's ability to assemble so many and at his unfailing inability to put anything in an individual way\".For a public man of Maugham's generation, being openly gay was impossible. Whether his own orientation disgusted him (as it did many at a time when homosexuality was widely considered a moral failing, as well as illegal) or whether he was trying to disguise his leanings, Maugham wrote disparagingly of the gay artist. In Don Fernando, a non-fiction book about his years living in Spain, Maugham pondered a (perhaps fanciful) suggestion that the painter El Greco was homosexual:\n\nIt cannot be denied that the homosexual has a narrower outlook on the world than the normal man. In certain respects the natural responses of the species are denied to him. Some at least of the broad and typical human emotions he can never experience. However subtly he sees life he cannot see it whole... I cannot now help asking myself whether what I see in El Greco's work of tortured fantasy and sinister strangeness is not due to such a sexual abnormality as this.\n\n\nMaugham's public view of his abilities remained modest. Towards the end of his career he described himself as \"in the very first row of the second-raters\". In 1948 he wrote Great Novelists and Their Novels (also known as Ten Novels and Their Authors and The Art of Fiction), in which he listed the ten best novels of world literature in his view.Maugham was appointed a Companion of Honour in the 1954 Birthday Honours.\nMaugham had begun collecting theatrical paintings before the First World War; he continued to the point where his collection was second only to that of the Garrick Club. In 1948 he announced that he would bequeath this collection to the Trustees of the National Theatre. From 1951, about 14 years before his death, his paintings began their exhibition life. In 1994 they were placed on loan to the Theatre Museum in Covent Garden.\nSignificant works\nMaugham's masterpiece is generally agreed to be Of Human Bondage, a semi-autobiographical novel that deals with the life of the main character Philip Carey, who, like Maugham, was orphaned and brought up by his pious uncle. Philip's clubfoot causes him endless self-consciousness and embarrassment, echoing Maugham's struggles with his stutter and, as his biographer Ted Morgan notes, his homosexuality.Two of his later novels were based on historical people: The Moon and Sixpence is about the life of Paul Gauguin, and Cakes and Ale contains what were taken as thinly veiled and unflattering characterisations of the authors Thomas Hardy (who had died two years previously) and Hugh Walpole. Maugham himself denied any intention of doing this in a long letter to Walpole: \"I certainly never intended Alroy Kear to be a portrait of you. He is made up of a dozen people and the greater part of him is myself\"\u2014yet in an introduction written for the 1950 Modern Library edition of the work, he plainly states that Walpole was the inspiration for Kear (while denying that Thomas Hardy was the inspiration for the novelist Driffield). Maugham's last major novel, The Razor's Edge (1944), was a departure for him in many ways. While much of the novel takes place in Europe, its main characters are American, not British. The protagonist is a disillusioned veteran of the First World War, who abandons his wealthy friends and lifestyle, travelling to India seeking enlightenment. The story's themes of Eastern mysticism and war-weariness struck a chord with readers during the Second World War. It was adapted into a major motion picture, released in 1946, starring Tyrone Power as Larry Darrell, with Herbert Marshall as W.\u00a0Somerset Maugham. Another film adaptation was issued in 1984, starring Bill Murray.\nAmong his short stories, some of the most memorable are those dealing with the lives of Western, mostly British, colonists in the Pacific Islands and Asia. They typically express the emotional toll the colonists bear by their isolation. \"Rain\", \"Footprints in the Jungle\", and \"The Outstation\" are considered especially notable. \"Rain\", in particular, which charts the moral disintegration of a missionary attempting to convert prostitute Sadie Thompson, has kept its reputation. It has been adapted as a play and as several films. His The Magician (1908) is based on British occultist Aleister Crowley.Maugham was one of the most significant travel writers of the inter-war years and can be compared with contemporaries such as Evelyn Waugh and Freya Stark. His best efforts in this line include The Gentleman in the Parlour, dealing with a journey through Burma, Siam, Cambodia and Vietnam, and On a Chinese Screen, a series of very brief vignettes that might have been sketches for stories left unwritten.\nInfluence\nIn 1947 Maugham instituted the Somerset Maugham Award, awarded to the best British writer or writers under the age of 35 for a work of fiction published in the past year. Notable winners include V.\u00a0S. Naipaul, Kingsley Amis, Martin Amis and Thom Gunn. On his death, Maugham donated his royalties to the Royal Literary Fund.Other writers acknowledged his work. Anthony Burgess praised his influence. Ian Fleming noted that he wrote the short story \"Quantum of Solace\" as an homage to Maugham's writing style. George Orwell said that Maugham was \"the modern writer who has influenced me the most, whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills\". In his novel Misery, Stephen King places a rich collection of Maugham's books in the house where most of the plot is set, and incidentally praises Maugham's mastery of storytelling.\n\nPortraits\nMany portraits were painted of Somerset Maugham, including that by Graham Sutherland in the Tate Gallery, and several by Sir Gerald Kelly. Sutherland's portrait was included in the exhibition Painting the Century: 101 Portrait Masterpieces 1900\u20132000 at the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nBibliography\nFilm adaptations\nThe Land of Promise (1917), directed by Joseph Kaufman and starring Thomas Meighan and David van Eyck.

His real name was Takahama Kiyoshi (\u9ad8\u6d5c\u6e05); Kyoshi was a pen name given to him by his mentor, Masaoka Shiki.\n\nEarly life\nKyoshi was born in what is now the city of Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture; his father, Ikenouchi Masatada, was a former samurai and fencing master and was also a fan of the traditional noh drama. However, with the Meiji Restoration, he lost his official posts and retired as a farmer. Kyoshi grew up in this rural environment, which influenced his affinity with nature. At age nine he inherited from his grandmother's family, and took her surname of Takahama. He became acquainted with Masaoka Shiki via a classmate, Kawahigashi Hekigoto.\nIgnoring Shiki's advice, Kyoshi quit school in 1894, and went to Tokyo to study Edo period Japanese literature. In 1895, he enrolled in the T\u014dky\u014d Senmon Gakk\u014d (present-day Waseda University), but soon left the university for a job as an editor and literary criticism for the literary magazine Nihonjin. While working, he also submitted variants on haiku poetry, experimenting with irregular numbers of syllables. He married in 1897.\n\nLiterary career\nIn 1898, Kyoshi came to manage the haiku magazine Hototogisu, which had been previously edited by Shiki, and moved the headquarters of the magazine from Matsuyama to Tokyo. In Hototogisu, he kept with the traditional style of haiku, as opposed to the new trend having been developed in the Hekigo school, which did not follow the traditional pattern of 17 syllables. Kyoshi attached importance to the symbolic function of the kigo (season word), and he tried to exclude the more modern trend towards season-less haiku completely. While editing Hototogisu, he also expanded its scope to include waka poems and prose, so that it became a general literary magazine. This was where Natsume S\u014dseki's Wagahai wa Neko de aru (\"I Am a Cat\") was first published, and Kyoshi contributed his own verses and short stories. These stories were collected into an anthology Keito (\"Cockscomb\", 1908), with a foreword by Natsume S\u014dseki, who described the contents as \"leisurely tales\".\nIn 1908, Kyoshi began a full-length novel, Haikaishi (\"The Haiku Master\"), which appeared in newspapers in serialized form. This was followed by Bonjin (\"An Ordinary Person\", 1909), and Ch\u014dsen (\"Korea\", 1912).\nAfter 1912, he renewed his interest in haiku, and published a commentary on haiku composition, Susumubeki haiku no michi (\"The Path Haiku Ought to Take\", 1915\u20131917). However, he continued to write short stories, edit Hototogisu, and wrote another novel, Futatsu Kaki (\"Two Persimmons\", 1915). In addition, he began to show an interest in traditional Noh theatre, writing some new plays himself.\nKyoshi wrote 40,000 to 50,000 haiku in his lifetime, which appeared in anthologies such as Kyoshi-kush\u016b and Gohyaku-ku. His major postwar novel was Niji (\"Rainbow\", 1947).\nIn 1954, he was awarded the Order of Culture by the Japanese government. As editor of Hototogisu, Kyoshi was instrumental in bringing many new writers and poets into the literary world, including Mizuhara Shuoshi, Yamaguchi Seishi and Takano Suju. He also encouraged his second daughter Hoshino Tatsuko to publish her own haiku magazine, Tamamo.\nKyoshi moved to Kamakura in 1910 for his children's health and a fresh start for himself, and lived there for nearly 50 years until his death. His grave is at the temple of Jufuku-ji in Kamakura. He was posthumously awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 1st class, by the Japanese government.\n\nSee also\nJapanese literature\nList of Japanese authorsReferences\nExternal links\nEhime Prefectural Library Site\nTakahama Kyoshi Memorial Museum in Ashiya\n\n\n","78":"Jos\u00e9 Augusto Trinidad Mart\u00ednez Ruiz, better known by his pseudonym Azor\u00edn  (Spanish pronunciation:\u00a0[a\u03b8o\u02c8\u027ein]; June 8, 1873 \u2013 March 2, 1967), was a Spanish novelist, essayist and literary critic. As a political radical in the 1890s, he moved steadily to the right. In literature he attempted to define the eternal qualities of Spanish life. His essays and criticism are written in a simple, compact style. Particularly notable are his impressionistic descriptions of Castilian towns and landscape.\n\nEarly life and education\nJos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz was born in the village of Mon\u00f2ver, Spain in the province of Alicante on 8 June 1873. He was the oldest of nine children and enjoyed reading in his youth. His father, a middle-class lawyer, was an active conservative politician and later became a representative and mayor, and a follower of Romero Robledo. His mother, a landowner, was born in nearby Petrel. From the age of eight, until he was 16, he attended a boarding school run by the Escolapius Fathers (Piarists) in his father's home town of Yecla in the province of Murcia. \nFrom 1888 to 1896 he studied law at the University of Valencia, but did not complete his studies. Thereafter he began to write, publishing a monograph on literary criticism in 1893. Here he began to write for local newspapers, contributing articles to the radical journal El pueblo, edited by Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. He became interested in the ideas of Karl Krause, who argued that man could be reformed through education, and that openness to other nation's cultures could overcome national conservatism.\nIn 1895, Ruiz published Anarquistas literarios and Notas sociales, in which he presented the main anarchist theories of the time. During this time he was a political radical. Ruiz became an admirer of the liberal Prime Minister Antonio Maura, who fought the culture of \"caciques\" (local political bosses), and who had become the figurehead of a youth movement, the Mauristas, who wanted him as a new head of state of Spain at a time of substantial resentment of King Alfonso XIII.\n\nCareer, writing and political evolution\nRuiz\u2019s journalism developed on moving to Madrid in 1896. He wrote for the republican newspaper El Pa\u00eds until he was dismissed for his radicalism in February 1897. He also wrote for the Paris-based anarchist magazine La Campa\u00f1a, and other Spanish journals including El Progreso (\"Progress\"), and El Imparcial (\"The impartial\"). His output during this period displayed anti-establishment views, including anarchist ideas, seeing writing as a catalyst for change, and depreciating aesthetics and faith.\nHowever, by 1899 his outlook was beginning to change. His work began to display a new philosophical and artistic consciousness, and an interest in the past. His book El alma castellana (The Castilian Soul), and his essay collections, La ruta de Don Quijote (The Route of Don Quixote) and, much later, Una hora de Espa\u00f1a 1560\u20131590 (Spain's Hour, 1560\u20131590) capture the essence of being Spanish.  He was abandoning revolutionary ideas, but becoming more nihilist, though respecting the dignity of human beings, and using irony to stand at arm's length from the world. This pessimism would eventually lead him to a period of political conservatism\n\nIn 1902 he published the first of three intensely biographical novels, La voluntad (Volition), followed by Antonio Azor\u00edn, and Las confesiones de un peque\u00f1o fil\u00f3sofo (The Confessions of a Minor Philosopher). Early in his career, Ruiz had used pen names, such as C\u00e1ndido (in honor of Voltaire) and Ahrim\u00e1n (the Persian god of destruction), and in 1904 he discarded his own name and began to use the surname of one of his characters, \"Azor\u00edn\". Using mostly short sentences, in both his fiction and his essays he emphasized the small but enduring elements and events in history and in one's life. In his view, time consisted of a series of repetitions, a notion of time described as \"timeless\". He married Julia Guinda Urzanqui in 1908; she was to remain beside him for the rest of life and outlive him. She died in 1974 aged 98. They had no children. By 1913 he was writing for ABC, the popular pro-monarchy, conservative newspaper, including a series of articles on \u201cLa generaci\u00f3n de 1898\u201d (Generation of 98), a literary and artistic group to which he belonged.\nRuiz served as a conservative deputy in the Cortes Generales  from 1907 to 1919, eventually becoming an under-secretary for the Ministry of Public Instruction. He gave up politics in opposition to the dictatorship of Gen. Primo de Rivera, though he never opposed him publicly. He had by now become noted as a drama critic and essayist. His literary criticism, such as Al margen de los cl\u00e1sicos (Marginal Notes to the Classics), Don Juan and Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s, helped to open up new avenues of literary taste and to arouse a new enthusiasm for the Spanish classics at a time when a large portion of Spanish literature was virtually unavailable to the public.  In 1924, he was elected to the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola. His first of a dozen plays, Old Spain, appeared in 1926, followed by Brandy mucho brandy and La comedia del arte, but had difficulty in adapting his slow and meticulous style to the dynamics and rhythm of drama. A wry comedy about journalists increasing newspaper sales by inventing stories, El Clamor (The Cry), led to the leadership of the Asociaci\u00f3n de la Prensa expelling him, an act which Azor\u00edn likened to that of the Inquisition. He began to be influenced by the avant-garde movement, experimenting in a personal version of surrealism in a short trilogy, Lo invisible (The Invisible).\nThe outbreak of the Republic saw him re-adopt his old progressive political ideals. He abandoned ABC to write for the republican newspapers El Sol, La Libertad and Ahora). He edited Revista de Occidente, founded by Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset, a journal promoting European philosophy, from 1923 to 1936. At the outset of the Spanish Civil War, in 1936, Azor\u00edn fled to Paris, where he continued his literary career writing for the Argentine newspaper La Naci\u00f3n. A book reflecting on this period of exile, Espa\u00f1oles en Par\u00eds, was published in 1939.\nWhen he returned to Spain on 23 August 1939, he found himself in \"inner exile\", along with other intellectuals who had not overtly supported the Franco regime during the conflict. He was at first denied a press identification card (tarjeta de periodista), but was supported by Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er, at that time Franco's Interior Minister and president of the Falange. Accepting Franco\u2019s regime was the price he had to pay in order to be admitted back, and he aligned with the dictatorship in a noted article in the right-wing journal V\u00e9rtice. He contributed again to ABC from 1941 to 1962. He published numerous new works which were redolent of his earlier literary successes, including Pensando en Espa\u00f1a and Sintiendo Espa\u00f1a.\n\nLater life\nIn his old age, Azor\u00edn became a film enthusiast, writing numerous articles, some of which are reprinted in El cine y el momento, and claiming that \"Cinema is the greatest form of art\". He died in Madrid, Spain on March 2, 1967, at the age of 93.The political evolution that transformed Ruiz, a committed journalist as well as a revolutionary anarchist, into Azor\u00edn, a conservative member of parliament, as well as a sceptic and indulgent writer intimidated by Franco's regime, is key to understanding the division of his critics. Two different images of him were sustained, successive and irreconcilable personalities that cannot be studied at the same time without understanding the contradictions.\nHonors\n1917, Hijo Predilecto de Mon\u00f2ver.\n1924, Elected to the Royal Spanish Academy\n1946, Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic\n1956, Grand Cross of the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise.\n1969, His home in Mon\u00f2ver established as a museum, Casa-Museo Azor\u00ednPublications\nSee also\nList of essayists\nList of Spanish writers\nList of Spanish-language authorsReferences\nFurther reading\nS\u00e1enz, Paz, ed.

The trademark element of his style was the almost clinical precision with which he dissected the psychologies and motivations of his characters.\n\nBiography\nBorn as the son of a physician, Binet-Valmer initially also studied medicine, but later turned his attention towards writing novels and reviews. Although Binet-Valmer was not homosexual himself, several of his novels, particularly his most famous one, Lucien, deal with homosexual themes and characters.\nLucien was by far Binet-Valmer's most successful book in France, getting released in no fewer than 22 printings between its first edition in 1910 and 1919. It also caused a minor scandal because of its\u2014for the time\u2014risqu\u00e9 discussion of homosexuality. Marcel Proust's opinion of Lucien was damning\u2014he wrote that it was the stupidest book he had ever read (le livre le plus imb\u00e9cile que j'aie jamais lu). Other critics, such as Edmond Jaloux, had a far more favorable attitude towards the book. The ending of Lucien was very unusual for the time, because instead of having Lucien commit suicide (then considered more or less the standard ending for a novel with a homosexual protagonist), in the final paragraph Binet-Valmer lets him elope to Naples together with his boyfriend Reginald Green.\nAs a journalist, Binet-Valmer wrote for magazines such as Mercure de France, Le Matin, and Revue de Paris. He also indirectly caused Proust to change the title of his magnum opus, In Search of Lost Time: Initially it was called Les Intermittences du c\u0153ur, but when Proust learned that Binet-Valmer had published the novel Le C\u0153ur en d\u00e9sordre (1912), the name was changed to \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu, with the former title making an appearance as a subtitle in the volume Sodome et Gomorrhe (1921\/22). However, Proust later acknowledged in a letter to Jacques Boulenger, editor of L'Opinion, that \"the whole press (except Binet-Valmer) deserted\" him \"about Sodome et Gomorrhe\".Novelist Georges Simenon was an assistant to Binet-Valmer for a few months in late 1922 and used that encounter for episodes in two of his novels (Les Noces de Poitiers and Le Passage de la ligne).After the 1930s, Binet-Valmer fell into relative obscurity, especially compared to his contemporary Marcel Proust whose fame has eclipsed Binet-Valmer's ever since.\n\nWorks\nLe Sphinx de pl\u00e2tre, 1900\nLes M\u00e9t\u00e8ques, roman de m\u0153urs parisiennes, 1900\nLe Gamin tendre, 1901\nLucien, Ollendorff, 1910; Flammarion, 1921\nNotre pauvre amour, 1911\nLe C\u0153ur en d\u00e9sordre, 1912\nLa Cr\u00e9ature, 1913\nLa Passion, 1914\nM\u00e9moires d'un engag\u00e9 volontaire, Flammarion, 1918\u00a0; Nabu Press, 2010\nLe Mendiant magnifique, 1919\nL'Enfant qui meurt, 1921\nLes Jours sans gloire, 1922\nLe Plaisir, illustr\u00e9 par des bois de Paul Baudier, 1923\nLe D\u00e9sordre, 1923\nLe D\u00e9sir et le P\u00e9ch\u00e9, 1923\nUne femme a tu\u00e9, 1924\nLe Sang, 1924\nLes Exalt\u00e9es, 1925\nCeux qui ne volent pas, 1926\nUn grand Fran\u00e7ais: Coligny, 1927\nSur le sable couch\u00e9es, Flammarion, 1928\nIrina l'exil\u00e9e, 1928\nLa Vie amoureuse de Marie Walewska, la femme polonaise de Napol\u00e9on, 1928\nLa Trag\u00e9die du retour, roman de l'amour et de l'\u00e2ge, 1929\nLa Lumi\u00e8re, roman d'une c\u00e9cit\u00e9, 1929\nLa Foire d'empoigne, roman d'une autre r\u00e9publique, Flammarion, 1930\nLa Femme qui travaille, Flammarion, 1930\nLa Prostitu\u00e9e ing\u00e9nue, 1930\nLe Jardin de l'impure, 1930\nLa Luxure, 1932\nMa\u00eetres du monde, 1933\nLe Regard, 1934\nBathilde et l'Assassin, 1935\nSarah Bernhardt, 1936\nLe Fumier, 1936\nLa Princesse nue, Fayard, 1937\nL'H\u00e9ritage, 1938\nLes Esprits de t\u00e9n\u00e8bres, 1940References\nBinet-Valmer: Lucien.

He is known in the west as Yone Noguchi. He was the father of noted sculptor Isamu Noguchi.\n\nBiography\nEarly life in Japan\nNoguchi was born in what is now part of the city of Tsushima, near Nagoya.  He attended Keio University in Tokyo, where he was exposed to the works of Thomas Carlyle and Herbert Spencer, and also expressed interests in haiku and Zen. He lived for a time in the home of Shiga Shigetaka, editor of the magazine Nihonjin, but left before graduating to travel to San Francisco in November 1893. \n\nCalifornia\nNoguchi arrived in San Francisco on November 19, 1893. There, he joined a newspaper run by Japanese exiles associated with the Freedom and People's Rights Movement and worked as a domestic servant.  He spent some months at Palo Alto, California studying at a preparatory school for Stanford University but returned to journalistic work in San Francisco during the Sino-Japanese War. \nOn a visit to the Oakland hillside home of Joaquin Miller after the war ended, Noguchi decided his true vocation was to be a poet.  Miller welcomed and encouraged Noguchi and introduced him to other San Francisco Bay area bohemians, including Gelett Burgess (who published Noguchi's first verses in his magazine, The Lark), Ina Coolbrith, Edwin Markham, Adeline Knapp, Blanche Partington, and Charles Warren Stoddard. \nNoguchi weathered a plagiarism scandal in 1896 to publish two books of poetry in 1897, and remained an important fixture of the Bay Area literary scene until his departure to the East Coast in May of 1900.\n\nFurther travels\nStopping in Chicago for several weeks, Noguchi befriended artist William Denslow, writer Onoto Watanna, and journalist Frank Putnam, and was invited to write his impressions of the city for the Chicago Evening Post.\nHe initially found New York unwelcoming. In September 1900 he made his long-awaited visit to Charles Warren Stoddard in Washington D.C. As \"After many years of passionate correspondence across long distances,\" writes historian Amy Sueyoshi, \"they had finally consummated their affection for one another in person.\"  From 1900 to 1904, Noguchi's primary base was New York City. There, with the help of editor and future lover L\u00e9onie Gilmour, he completed work on his first novel, The American Diary of a Japanese Girl, and a sequel, The American Letters of a Japanese Parlor-Maid.\nNoguchi then sailed to England, where (with the help of his artist friend Yoshio Markino) he self-published and promoted his third book of poetry, From the Eastern Sea, and formed connections with leading literary figures like William Michael Rossetti, Laurence Binyon, William Butler Yeats, Thomas Hardy, Laurence Housman, Arthur Symons and the young Arthur Ransome.  \nHis London success brought him some attention on his return to New York in 1903, and he formed productive new friendships with American writers like Edmund Clarence Stedman, Zona Gale, and even Mary MacLane, but he continued to have difficulty publishing in the United States. He spent much of the summer of 1903 selling curios at Kushibiki and Arai's \"Japan by Night\" installation at Madison Square Garden, \u201cdoing a pretty good business, selling things between 7 and 12 dollars a night,\u201d telling Stoddard it was \u201cawfully jolly to do such a thing upon the roof full of fresh air and music.\u201dThis changed with the onset of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, when Noguchi's writings on various aspects of Japanese culture were suddenly in great demand among magazine editors.  He was able to publish a number of seminal articles at this time, including \"A Proposal to American Poets,\" in which he advised American poets to \"try Japanese hokku.\"\nRomantic entanglements\nWhile in the United States, Noguchi became romantically involved with Charles Warren Stoddard, L\u00e9onie Gilmour and Ethel Armes. He had begun an amorous correspondence with Stoddard while still in California, and acknowledged that they slept in the same bed when he visited Stoddard in Washington, D.C. in 1900. He had met Ethel Armes at Stoddard's by Christmas 1901. He had hired L\u00e9onie Gilmour as an English teacher and editor in February 1901. By the end of 1903 Noguchi was secretly married to Gilmour and secretly engaged to Armes. Stoddard, when informed about the Armes engagement, repeatedly begged Noguchi to end it.\n\n\n\n\nHaving (he thought) ended his brief, secret marriage to L\u00e9onie Gilmour in the early months of 1904, Noguchi made plans to return to Japan and marry Ethel Armes. At this point, the Russo-Japanese War was in progress and Armes, now in Birmingham, Alabama had taken over as Noguchi's editor amid a greatly increased demand for Noguchi's articles on Japanese topics. \n\nReturn to Japan\nNoguchi returned to Japan in August 1904, and became a professor of English at his alma mater Keio University the following year, but his marriage plans were spoiled when it became known that L\u00e9onie Gilmour had given birth to Noguchi's son (the future sculptor Isamu Noguchi) in Los Angeles. He moved to the Koishikawa neighborhood of Tokyo in November 1905, and published an anthology of prose poetry in English, The Summer Cloud, shortly thereafter.\nFrom November 1906 to January 1908, Noguchi wrote a literary criticism column almost every week for the Japan Times, among the more notable of which was the November 3, 1907 \"Mr. Yeats and the No,\" advising William Butler Yeats to study the Noh drama. \"He has been attempting to reform and strengthen the Western stage through his own little plays which are built on Irish legend or history; and so far, in his own way, he is successful.  I feel happy to think that he would find his own ideal in our No performance, if he should see and study it.\" After studying Ernest Fenollosa's Noh translations with Ezra Pound, Yeats staged his first Noh-style play, At the Hawk's Well, in 1916, eliciting Noguchi's approval in another Japan Times column.In 1907, L\u00e9onie and Isamu joined Noguchi in Tokyo, but the reunion proved short-lived, mainly because Noguchi had already married a Japanese woman, Matsu Takeda, before their arrival.  He and L\u00e9onie separated for good in 1910, although L\u00e9onie and Isamu continued to live in Japan.\nNoguchi continued to publish extensively in English after his return to Japan, becoming a leading interpreter of Japanese culture to Westerners, and of Western culture to the Japanese.  His 1909 poem collection, The Pilgrimage, was widely admired, as was a 1913 collection of essays, Through the Torii.  \n\nLectures abroad\nIn 1913, he made his second trip to Britain (via Marseille and Paris) to lecture on Japanese poetry at Magdalen College, Oxford at the invitation of poet laureate, Robert Bridges, also giving lectures to the Japan Society of London and reading at the Poetry Bookshop. While in London, he met with George Bernard Shaw, W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, Laurence Binyon, Arthur Symons, Sarojini Naidu, and numerous other noted literary figures, and also investigated the latest trends in British modern art, spending time with Roger Fry, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Joseph Pennell, Jacob Epstein and Henri Gaudier-Brzeska. In April the following year, while in Paris, he also met with T\u014dson Shimazaki who happened to be travelling in Europe at the time. Noguchi traveled back to Japan via Berlin and Moscow using the Trans-Siberian Railway. \nA collection of literary essays, Through the Torii had appeared at the time of Noguchi's arrival in Britain, and while there, he arranged the publication of The Spirit of Japanese Poetry, The Spirit of Japanese Art and The Story of Yone Noguchi. \nIn 1919\u201320, Noguchi made a transcontinental lecture tour of America under the aegis of the James B. Pond Lyceum Bureau, speaking at Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Chicago and the University of Utah, and the University of Toronto, among other places.\n\nJapanese poet and art critic\nAfter the publication of a collection of short poems entitled Japanese Hokkus in 1920, Noguchi devoted most of his English efforts to studies of ukiyo-e and began a belated career as a Japanese language poet. Noguchi's success as a Japanese poet has been questioned by Japanese scholars; Norimasa Morita states that Noguchi \"struggled to make a literary reputation for himself in Japan\" and that \"most of his Japanese poems received no critical or popular recognition\". Other scholars including Madoka Hori point to evidence of Noguchi's success such as the May 1926 Noguchi Yonejiro special number of the magazine Nippon Shijin (The Japanese Poet).Noguchi's extensive art-historical writings produced similarly divergent reactions. A book like The Ukiyoye Primitives (1933) could delight poet and editor Marianne Moore with its \"renovated language of unimpaired connotation\" while severely testing the patience of Harvard art historian Benjamin Rowland, Jr., by its unfamiliar \"manipulation of the language\" that \"frequently obscures the meaning of whole passages.\" Moore thought the book \"useful to the judge of prints\"; not Rowland, who complained that its aesthetic judgments \"tend toward the sentimental and are for the most part so superficial as to be of practically no value.\" Even Rowland, though, had to commend what he thought \"undoubtedly the finest reproductions in any work on Ukiyo-ye that has yet appeared in English.\"All of Noguchi's later books, in both Japanese and English, were published in Japan, for Noguchi encountered stiff resistance from American and British publishers in the 1930s, despite the support of a few sympathetic editors like Moore and R. A. Scott-James.\nThe war years\nNoguchi's politics tended to follow prevailing Japanese tendencies. In the 1920s, following the leftist turn of Taish\u014d democracy, he published in leftist magazines like Kaiz\u014d, but the 1930s, he followed the country's turn to the right.  Partly as a result of his friendship with leading Indian intellectuals like Rabindranath Tagore, Sarojini Naidu, and Rash Behari Bose, Noguchi was sent to India in 1935\u201336 to help gain support for Japanese objectives in East Asia, but he had little success. Noguchi and Tagore had a bitter exchange of letters in 1938 before their friendship ended over political and philosophical differences. During the Second World War, Noguchi supported the Japanese cause, advocating a no-holds-barred assault on the Western countries he had once admired.\n\nPostwar period\nIn April 1945, his house in Nakano, Tokyo was destroyed in the American Bombing of Tokyo. After the war, he succeeded in reconciling with his estranged son Isamu before dying of stomach cancer on July 13, 1947.\n\nCritical evaluations\nCritical evaluations of Noguchi, while varying drastically, have frequently stressed the enigmatic character of his work.  Arthur Symons referred to him as a \"scarcely to be apprehended personality.\" Arthur Ransome called him \"a poet whose poems are so separate that a hundred of them do not suffice for his expression.\" Ezra Pound, on first reading The Pilgrimage in 1911 wrote that \"His poems seem to be rather beautiful.  I don't quite know what to think about them.\"  Nishiwaki Junzabur\u014d wrote, \"Most of his earlier poems have always seemed to me so terrific, so bewildering, as to startle me out of reason or system.\"Noguchi was hailed in the pages of Poetry as a pioneering modernist, thanks to his early advocacy of free verse and association with modernist writers like Yeats, Ezra Pound, Richard Aldington, and John Gould Fletcher.\nNoguchi may be considered a cross-cultural, transnational, or cosmopolitan writer.  His work may also be considered, albeit somewhat more problematically, within the national literatures of Japan and the United States (see Japanese literature, American literature).  Noguchi has recently gained attention in Asian American studies due to the increasing interest in transnationalism.\nYone Noguchi is played by Nakamura Shid\u014d II in the film Leonie (2010).\n\nBooks in English by Yone Noguchi\nContributions to periodicals\nNoguchi contributed to numerous periodicals in the United States, Japan, England, and India, including: The Academy, Asahi Shimbun, Blackwood's, The Bookman, The Bookman, The Boston Transcript, The Brooklyn Eagle, The Calcutta Review, The Chap-Book, Ch\u016b\u014dk\u014dron, The Conservator, The Dallas Morning News, The Detroit Free Press, The Dial, The Double-Dealer, The Egoist, The Graphic, The Japan Times, Kaiz\u014d, The Lark, Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, London Mercury, Los Angeles Times, Mainichi Shinbun, Mita Bungaku, The Modern Review, My\u014dj\u014d, The Nation (London), The Nation (New York), The New Orleans Times-Democrat, The New York Globe, The New York Sun, The New York Times, The New-York Tribune, The Philistine, Poetry Magazine, Poet Lore, The Poetry Review, The Reader Magazine, St. Paul Globe, Sunset Magazine, T'ien Hsia Monthly, T.P.'s Weekly, Taiy\u014d, Teikoku Bungaku, The Visva-Bharati Quarterly, The Washington Post, The Westminster Gazette, and Yomiuri Shinbun.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Yone Noguchi at Wikimedia Commons\nYone Noguchi Project\nYone Noguchi, Japan, and English Language Verse\n\"Seduced by Nationalism: Yone Noguchi's 'Terrible Mistake.'

He held many public offices, including Brazilian congressional representative from Bahia in the federal C\u00e2mara de Deputados (federal congressman) (1924\u20131930), first the president of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, member of the Brazilian Cultural Center in the United States, president of the Academia Brasileira de Letras, and honorary doctorates from Coimbra University and the University of Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nBiography\nBorn in Len\u00e7\u00f3is and raised in the backlands of Bahia, and schooled mostly at home, Afr\u00e2nio Peixoto nevertheless graduated in medicine in Salvador, at Brazil's oldest medical school, in 1897, when he was only 21 years old. His work \"Epilepsy and crime\" attracted national and international attention. In 1902 he moved to the then-Brazilian capital, Rio de Janeiro, and became a public health inspector and the director of the local mental hospital (Hospital Nacional de Alienados, currently Hospital Juliano Moreira). In 1907 he began lecturing at the Faculdade de Medicina. He married Francisca de Faria, in 1912, and they had one child, a son, \"Juquinha\" (\"Little Juca\"), who was both mentally ill and of poor physical health and who died in 1942. The extent to which his son's disabilities may have influenced Afr\u00e2nio's opinions as a eugenicist is still debated. Dr. J\u00falio Afr\u00e2nio Peixoto died of prostate cancer in Rio de Janeiro on January 12, 1947, at 70 years of age.\n\nMedicine\nAfr\u00e2nio Peixoto was a student and follower of Juliano Moreira, who initiated the scientific treatment of mental illness in Brazil and who invited his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to Rio de Janeiro.\nAfr\u00e2nio Peixoto was active in many areas: mental health, public health, criminology, and workers' health. He was important in establishing the foundations of workers' health when he took the chair of forensic medicine in both the medical and law schools in Rio de Janeiro in 1907. From his pioneering studies of occupational risks and job-related accidents and diseases, many publications were released, and legal safety nets were finally established for Brazilian workers.\nThe only negative aspect of Afr\u00e2nio Peixoto's highly successful career in medicine was his dispute with Brazilian parasitologist Carlos Chagas over the cause of what later became known as Chagas disease. Afr\u00e2nio Peixoto used his influence and prestige to dispute Carlos Chagas' clinical and parasitological findings and to transfer credit for the discovery of the trypanosome to Oswaldo Cruz, much to the disadvantage of everyone concerned. Chagas disease is a chronic and debilitating parasitosis caused by a trypanosome that is vectored by a biting bug in rural areas. A commission of the Brazilian National Academy of Medicine reviewed the evidence and decided completely in favor of Carlos Chagas and against Afr\u00e2nio Peixoto, whose real motive may have been professional resentment when he was passed over for the directorship of the Brazilian Department of Public Health in preference for his rival.\n\nLiterature\nIt is in his writings that Afr\u00e2nio Peixoto lives on, although most of his vast and varied literary output is currently out of print in Brazil and has apparently not been translated. The Library of Congress online catalog [1] shows no English language translations and few modern editions in Portuguese (see: Peixoto, Afr\u00e2nio). Other Brazilian literary figures of the first half of the twentieth century have fared better in the public's memory. The humorous short story The Alienist by Machado de Assis, for example, is required reading for many Brazilian university entrance exams, but students do not know that this could almost be a satire on Afr\u00e2nio Peixoto and the Hospital Nacional de Alienados that he directed.\nAfr\u00e2nio Peixoto's principal works are: Rosa m\u00edstica, drama (1900); Lufada sinistra, novel (1900); A esfinge, novel (1911); Maria Bonita, novel (1914); Minha terra e minha gente, history (1915); Poeira da estrada, literary criticism (1918); Trovas brasileiras (1919); Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio, o velho e o mo\u00e7o, biography (1920); Fruta do mato, novel (1920); Castro Alves, o poeta e o poema (1922); Bugrinha, novel (1922); Dicion\u00e1rio dos Lus\u00edadas, linguistic dictionary (1924); Cam\u00f5es e o Brasil, essays (1926); Arte po\u00e9tica, essay (1925); As raz\u00f5es do cora\u00e7\u00e3o, novel (1925); Uma mulher como as outras, novel (1928); Hist\u00f3ria da literatura brasileira (1931); Panorama da literatura brasileira (1940); Pepitas, essays (1942); Collected works (1942); Literary works, ed. Jackson, 25 vols. (1944); Collected novels (1962). In addition to these, he published the commented works of other authors and numerous books on medicine, history, oratory, and literature.\nIn 2017, the Brazilian copyright on Afr\u00e2nio Peixoto's works expires; after this, they can be distributed freely on the internet.\n\nPolitical views\nIn his political views, amply expressed while he was living, J\u00falio Afr\u00e2nio claimed to be on the side of whatever government is in power. During his lifetime Brazil had five constitutions and ranged from democracy to dictatorship under Get\u00falio Vargas. Afr\u00e2nio was a leftist, but not a fanatical leftist. He was interested in human genetics and eugenics. He held now-discredited views on race, but he was never antisemitic. J\u00falio Afr\u00e2nio Peixoto was also an atheist and a freemason.\n\nSee also\nArticle on Afr\u00e2nio Peixoto in the Portuguese language Wikipedia (in Portuguese)References\nJoaquim A.

His father, Albert, was a draper and his mother, Sophia, was the sister of the philosopher Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rauh.\nHe was a brilliant student, a Grand Prize winner in France's Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and a literary and humanities CPGE philosophy student at Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV. However, he abandoned his studies to become a columnist in various magazines. Leading a bohemian life, he devoted himself to writing and art criticism.\n\nCareer\nWerth was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and friend of Octave Mirbeau, the author of The Diary of a Chambermaid, completing Mirabeau's final novel, Dingo, for him when the author's health failed.  He manifested his anti-clericalism as an independently minded anti-bourgeois anarchist. His first significant novel, La Maison blanche, which Mirabeau prefaced, was a Prix Goncourt finalist in 1913.At the outbreak of the First World War, Werth, 34, having earlier completed his active-duty and reserve service, was mobilized into the territorial army and, as such, assigned to the rear. Despite opposing the war, he volunteered for combat duty first as a rifleman then as a radio operator, spending time in one of the worst sectors of the war before being invalided out by a lung infection after 15 months' service. Shortly after, he completed Clavel, soldat, a pessimistic and virulently anti-war work that caused a scandal when it was released in 1919 but which was later cited as among the most faithful depictions of trench warfare in Jean Norton Cru's monumental 1929 survey of French World War I literature.Werth was an unclassifiable writer with an acid prose, who wrote of the inter-war period as well as advocating against colonialism (Cochinchine, 1928). He also wrote against the colonial period splendor of the French empire, and against Stalinism which he denounced as a leftist deception. He also criticized the mounting Nazi movement.\nIn 1931 when he met Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, it was the beginning of a very close friendship. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince) would be dedicated to Werth.\nAfter the Fall of France, during its occupation, the Werths remained in France despite offers by the Centre americain de secours in Marseille to help them emigrate. In July 1941 Werth was required to register as Jewish, his travel was restricted and his works banned from publication. His wife, Suzanne, was active in the Resistance, crossing the demarcation line clandestinely more than a dozen times and establishing their Paris apartment as a safe house for fugitive Jewish women, downed British and Canadian pilots, secret resistance meetings and storage of false identity papers and illegal radio transmitters. Their son, Claude, continued his studies first in the Jura and then in Paris, later becoming a doctor.  Werth lived poorly in the Jura Mountain region, alone, cold and often hungry. D\u00e9position, his diary, was published in 1946, delivering a damning indictment of Vichy France. He became a Gaullist under the Nazi occupation and after the war contributed to the Libert\u00e9 de l'Esprit intellectual magazine run by Claude Mauriac.\n\nAntoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry met Werth in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's closest friend outside of the flying group of his Aeropostale associates.  Werth did not have much in common with Saint-Exup\u00e9ry; he was an anarchist, his father was a Jew, and a leftist Bolshevik supporter. Being twenty-two years older than Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, with a surrealistic writing style as well as the author of twelve volumes and many magazine pieces, he was Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's very opposite. But the younger author admired Werth's writing for having \"never deceived,\" and wrote that Werth's essence was \"his search for truth, his observation and the simple utility of his prose.\" Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Letter to a Hostage includes a celebration of Werth's journalism, and in her note on the text, Fran\u00e7oise Gerbod, professor emeritus of French literature at the University of Paris, credits Werth with having been Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's literary mentor.Saint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicated two books to him, (Letter to a Hostage and The Little Prince), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War, while writing The Little Prince, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking about his native France and his friends. L\u00e9on Werth spent the war unobtrusively in Saint-Amour, his village in the Jura, a mountainous region near Switzerland where he \"was alone, cold and hungry\", and which had few nice words for French refugees. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry returned to the conflict by joining the Free French Air Force in early 1943, rationalizing, \"I cannot bear to be far from those who are hungry... I am leaving in order to suffer and thereby be united with those who are dear to me.\"\nAt the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry didn't live to see, L\u00e9on Werth said: \"Peace, without Tonio [Saint-Exup\u00e9ry], isn't entirely peace.\" Leon Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend's death, when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's French publisher, Gallimard, sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris on 13 December 1955. His remains and those of his wife, Suzanne, are deposited in the columbarium at Paris's P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery.\n\nThe Little Prince dedication\nWerth is mentioned in the preamble to The Little Prince, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicates the book to him:\nTo Leon WerthI ask children to forgive me for dedicating this book to a grown-up.  I have a serious excuse: this grown-up is the best friend I have in the world.  I have another excuse: this grown-up can understand everything, even books for children.  I have a third excuse: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold.  He needs to be comforted.  If all these excuses are not enough then I want to dedicate this book to the child whom this grown-up once was.  All grown-ups were children first. (But few of them remember it.)  So I correct my dedication:To Leon Werth,\nWhen he was a little boySaint-Exup\u00e9ry's aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend's disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of The Little Prince, in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had published a fable the previous year in the United States, which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to Werth.\n33 jours posthumous publication\n33 jours (33 Days) is Werth's memoir of l'exode (the exodus) during the Fall of France. The title refers to the period of time he, his wife and their son's former nanny spent on the road during their flight from Paris to their summer home in Saint-Amour in the Jura region. (His son Claude, then 15, and teenage friends covered the distance in less than a day by leaving several hours earlier, thus avoiding the detours mandated by the French army that are described in 33 jours; the couple had no news of their son until they were all reunited a month later in Saint-Amour.)  With poetic economy and journalistic precision, Werth recounts his experiences as one of the estimated eight million civilians who fled the advancing German army's invasion of Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg and France in May\u2013June 1940, possibly using notes set down during the event, as he did in the trenches in World War I (which he used for his novels Clavel soldat and Clavel chez les majors). Werth gave the manuscript to his friend Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in October 1940 to smuggle out of France, write a preface for and publish in the U.S. The New York publisher Brentano's bought the rights (for a military parcel of cigarettes, gum, chocolates and water-purification tablets) and publication was planned for 1943, in expectation of which Saint-Exup\u00e9ry referred to it as \"un grand livre\" (an important book) in his 1942 novel Pilote de guerre.  For reasons unclear it was never published, and the manuscript effectively disappeared.\nWhen Saint-Exup\u00e9ry realized that an English translation of 33 jours was not forthcoming, he extensively revised the preface (excising Werth's name to protect him) and published it as a stand-alone essay. Letter to a Hostage is an affecting meditation on home and exile set during the escape from France via Lisbon to the U.S. (he was on the same vessel as Jean Renoir) that enabled the pilot to continue his struggle against the Germans from abroad.It was not until 1992 that Viviane Hamy found and published the missing manuscript. In 2002 a student edition was produced, and 33 jours became part of the syllabus in French secondary schools. Hamy led a rediscovery of Werth, republishing many of his works in the 1990s and 2000s. 33 jours was finally published in English in 2015 as 33 Days in a new translation by Austin Denis Johnston.\nDeposition 1940-1944\nThree years after 33 Days appeared in English, Oxford University Press published the diary Werth wrote when he reached Saint-Amour after his exodus on the roads, sub-titling it \"A Secret Diary of Life in Vichy France.\" It is translated by David Ball. Had it not been \u201csecret,\u201d the authorities would have had two reasons for deporting its author to Auschwitz: not only was he Jewish, he was subversive. Deposition is his sharply observed, often ironic, almost daily record of life in the French countryside during the Occupation and, at the end, the insurrection during the liberation of Paris. If he had stayed there, he might have been one of the 50,000 Jews deported from the city and exterminated.  Alone in his house, with the habit of writing, no other work, and the obvious impossibility of publishing during the war, he made entries in his diary almost every day: noting what people said, what he saw, and what he heard on the radio and read in the press, often with comments like this: \n\u201cMonsieur de Gaulle (that\u2019s what the paper calls him) and General Catroux have been stripped of their French nationality.\u201d \nSo has France. (December 12, 1940)\nThe events \u201cafter the fall of France\u201d described above are entered in the diary as they happened. When registering as Jewish, for example, Werth says he sang out the word \u201cJewish\u201d as if he were singing the Marseillaise. He also uses his gifts as a novelist to give us portraits of the peasants, shopkeepers and railroad workers in and around the village of Saint-Amour. We see what they are like and hear, in their own words, what they think of Vichy\u2014not much, though many trust P\u00e9tain\u2014and how it affects their lives. The diary in French is 750 pages, far too long to be assigned in classrooms, but the English edition is less than half as long. It is his most important book in English to date. \nWerth returned to Paris in January 1944 but could only venture out at night until just before the Liberation. He describes the activities of a Resistance cell in their apartment: British aviators hid there until they could be smuggled out of the country. R\u00e9sistants on the run hid out for a few days in their apartment and then set out for a new mission. In August, he reports the exciting advance of the Allied armies toward Paris and during the last week, he reports the street-fighting he saw in Paris during the liberation of the city. The diary ends with his capture of German prisoners huddled on a tank (he pities them), and the triumphal parade of General de Gaulle down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\n\nCommemorative events\nVarious events were organized in 2005 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Werth's death.\n\nBooks\nPuvis de Chavannes (1909)\nLa maison blanche (1913)\nC\u00e9zanne (1914)\nMeubles Modernes (1914)\nClavel soldat (1919)\nClavel chez les majors (1919)\nVoyages avec ma pipe (1920)\nYvonne et Pijallet (1920)\nLes amants invisibles (1921)\nVlaminck (1921)\nDix-neuf ans (1922)\nLe monde et la ville (1922)\nUn soir de cirque (1922)\nHenri Matisse (1923) - with \u00c9lie Fuare, Jules Romains, Charles Vildrac\nBonnard (1923)\nQuelques Peintres (1923)\nDialogue sur la danse (1924-1925)\nDanse, danseurs, dancings (1925)\nCochinchine (1926)\nGhislaine (1926)\nMarthe et Le perroquet (1926)\nPijallet danse (1924)\nUne soir\u00e9e \u00e0 L'Olympia (1926)\nChana Ourloff (1927)\nClaude Monet (1928)\nK.X.

His two younger brothers, Ikuma Arishima (\u6709\u5cf6\u751f\u99ac) and Ton Satomi (\u91cc\u7f8e\u5f34), were also authors. His son was the internationally known film and stage actor, Masayuki Mori.\n\nEarly life\nArishima was born in Tokyo, Japan into a wealthy family as the son of an ex-samurai official in the Ministry of Finance. He was first sent to a mission school in Yokohama, where he was taught English, after which he entered preparatory school of the prestigious Gakushuin peer's school, when he was 10 years old.\nAfter he graduated from the Gakushuin at age 19, he entered the Sapporo Agricultural College (the present-day Faculty of Agriculture at Hokkaido University). During his studies at the university, he attempted suicide with Kokichi Morimoto (\u68ee\u672c\u539a\u5409). The suicide failed, and Arishima subsequently became influenced by Uchimura Kanz\u014d and became a Christian in 1901. Morimoto later went on to establish several women's schools around Japan.\nAfter graduation and a mandatory short stint in the Imperial Japanese Army, Arishima took English lessons from Mary Elkinton Nitobe, Inazo Nitobe's wife, and in July 1903, he obtained a position as a foreign correspondent in the United States for the Mainichi Shimbun. In the United States he enrolled at Haverford College (a Quaker institution outside of Philadelphia) and later Harvard University. After graduation, he briefly worked in an insane asylum operated by the Quaker sect.  He recorded his experiences from his journey to America in his diary.\nDuring his time in America, he became critical towards Christianity, attracted to socialism, and influenced by the works of writers such as Walt Whitman, Henrik Ibsen, and Peter Kropotkin. His time and experiences in America and subsequent year in Europe also profoundly influenced his writing style and his outlook on the world, resulting in feelings of alienation from Japanese society.\nAfter he returned to Japan in 1907, he re-entered the army briefly before becoming an English and ethics teacher in 1909 at his alma mater.\n\nLiterary career\nThrough his brother Arishima Ikuma, he also became acquainted with authors who graduated from the Gakushuin, including Naoya Shiga and Saneatsu Mushanok\u014dji.  Arishima and these writers formed a group, which was named after their literary magazine Shirakaba (\u767d\u6a3a, White Birch), which was first published in 1911. He wrote novels and literary criticisms and was known as one of the central figures in the Shirakaba group.\nArishima first achieved fame in 1917 with The Descendents of Cain (\u30ab\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u672b\u88d4, Kain no Matsuei), which depicts God\u2019s curse on both man and nature through the eyes of a self-destructive tenant farmer.  In 1919 he published his best-known work: A Certain Woman (\u6216\u308b\u5973, Aru Onna), a moral and psychological melodrama about a strong-willed woman struggling against a hypocritical male-dominated society. While critically acclaimed for his style, the themes and characters of Arishima\u2019s works did not appeal to many contemporary Japanese readers.\n\nLater life\nIn 1922, Arishima implemented the socialist philosophy he had been developing by renunciation of the ownership of a large tenant farm in Hokkaid\u014d, which he had inherited from his father, publicly stating that he wanted to distance himself from the petit bourgeois in the coming revolution.\nArishima married in 1910, but his wife died in 1916 of tuberculosis leaving him three children. In 1922, Arishima met Akiko Hatano, a married woman and an editor working for the Fujin Koron, a famous women's magazine. Their relationship quickly developed into an extramarital affair, which came to be known by Hatano's husband.  This led to Arishima and Hatano committing suicide in Karuizawa by hanging themselves. Due to the isolated location, their bodies were not discovered for over a month, and were identified largely by the suicide note left behind. Arishima's grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Tokyo.\n\nLegacy\nAfter his death, Arishima became known for his detailed diaries, covering more than twenty volumes, with an intimate record of his life, fears and hopes. His contemporaries regarded Arishima as a philosopher and social critic as much as a novelist. His writing was critical of Christianity and strongly influenced by socialism; emotionally intense, humanistic, and employed ideas from the Bible, Tolstoy, and anarchic socialism.\nArishima's major works include:\n\nAru Onna (\u6216\u308b\u5973, A Certain Woman) 1919\nKain no Matsuei (\u30ab\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u672b\u88d4, The Descendents of Cain), 1917Available in English\n*A Certain Woman, transl. by Kenneth Strong, University of Tokyo Press, 1978, 382 pages, ISBN\u00a00-86008-237-7.\nLabyrinth.

He used the pseudonym E. H. Visiak from 1910.\n\nLife\nHe was born in Ealing, London.  Both his father, Edward James Physick (the younger), and his grandfather, Edward James Physick (the elder), were sculptors. His maternal uncle was W. H. Helm, writer and critic.\nHe went to Hitchin Grammar School (now Hitchin Boys School), and became a clerk with the Indo-European Telegraph Company. He contributed poetry to The New Age and Dora Marsden's Freewoman.\nDuring World War I the poetry he wrote, in opposition to it, cost him his job. When conscription was introduced, he became a conscientious objector. After a short time teaching he became an independent scholar, living very quietly. During the 1930s he collaborated on some short stories, with John Gawsworth in particular.\nA friend and enthusiast of the Scottish novelist David Lindsay, Visiak wrote three short macabre novels, The Haunted Island, Medusa and The Shadow, and the autobiography Life's Morning Hour. He provided an introductory note for Lindsay's novel A Voyage to Arcturus.\nThe Haunted Island (1st edition Elkin Mathews, 1910; reprint Peter Lund, 1946) features the adventures of Francis and Dick Clayton in the seventeenth century, who sail a seized ship to one of the Juan Fernandez Islands. They there fall into the hands of pirates, meet a ghost, and a wizard who rules over a colony of slaves.  Ultimately they find a treasure.\nThe Shadow was not published separately but was incorporated in John Gawsworth's anthology Crimes, Creeps and Thrills (1936) (which also included Visiak's story \"Medusan Madness\").\nMuch of Visiak's supernatural work bears similarities to that of William Hope Hodgson since both writers were fascinated by the lure and power of the sea, which forms the focus of the majority of their literary work.\n\nCritical reception\nHis novel Medusa: A Story of Mystery (1929) became popular in the 1960s. Mike Ashley describes Medusa as Visiak's \"premier achievement\". Medusa was also included by horror historian Robert S. Hadji in his list of \"unjustly neglected\" horror novels. An essay on the novel by Karl Edward Wagner appears in the anthology Horror: 100 Best Books (1988; revised edition 1992). China Mi\u00e9ville has also expressed admiration for Visiak's work.\nWorks\nPoetry\nBuccaneer Ballads (1910)\nFlints and Flashes (1911)\nThe Phantom Ship (1912)\nThe Battle Fiends (1916)\nBrief Poems (1919)Novels\nThe Haunted Island (1910)\nMedusa: A Story of Mystery (1929)\nThe Shadow (1936)Literary criticism\nMilton's Agonistes: a metaphysical criticism (1923)\nMirror of Conrad (1956)\nThe Portent of Milton: Some Aspects of His Genius (1958)\nThe Strange Genius of David Lindsay (1970; with J.

Many of his novels examine class difference and hypocrisy, including A Room with a View (1908), Howards End (1910) and A Passage to India (1924). The last brought him his greatest success. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 16 separate years.\nEarly years\nForster, born at 6 Melcombe Place, Dorset Square, London NW1, a building no longer standing, was the only child of the Anglo-Irish Alice Clara \"Lily\" (n\u00e9e Whichelo) and a Welsh architect, Edward Morgan Llewellyn Forster. He was registered as Henry Morgan Forster, but accidentally baptised Edward Morgan Forster. His father died of tuberculosis on 30 October 1880 before Morgan's second birthday. In 1883, he and his mother moved to Rooks Nest, near Stevenage, Hertfordshire until 1893. This served as a model for Howards End in his novel of that name. It is listed Grade I for historic interest and literary associations. Forster had fond memories of his childhood at Rooks Nest.\nAmong Forster's ancestors were members of the Clapham Sect, a social reform group within the Church of England.\nForster inherited \u00a38,000 in trust (the equivalent of about \u00a3990,000 in 2017) from his paternal great-aunt Marianne Thornton (daughter of the abolitionist Henry Thornton), who died on 5 November 1887. The money was enough to live on and enabled him to become a writer. He attended as a day boy Tonbridge School in Kent, where the school theatre has been named in his honour, although he is known to have been unhappy there.At King's College, Cambridge, between 1897 and 1901, he became a member of a discussion society known as the Apostles (formally named the Cambridge Conversazione Society). They met in secret, and discussed their work on philosophical and moral questions. Many of its members went on to constitute what came to be known as the Bloomsbury Group, of which Forster was a member in the 1910s and 1920s. There is a famous recreation of Forster's Cambridge at the beginning of The Longest Journey. The Schlegel sisters of Howards End are based to some degree on Vanessa and Virginia Stephen.In 1904, Forster travelled in Greece and Italy as he was interested in their classical heritage. He then sought a post in Germany so that he could learn the language, and he spent several months in the summer of 1905 in Nassenheide, Pomerania, (now the Polish village of Rz\u0119dziny) working as a tutor to the children of the writer Elizabeth von Arnim; he wrote a short memoir of this experience which was one of the happiest times in his life.In 1906 he fell in love with Syed Ross Masood, a 17-year-old Indian future Oxford student he tutored in Latin. Masood had a more romantic, poetic view of friendship, confusing Forster with avowals of love.After leaving university, he travelled in continental Europe with his mother. They moved to Weybridge, Surrey, where he wrote all six of his novels.\nIn 1914, he visited Egypt, Germany and India with the classicist Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, by which time he had written all but one of his novels. As a conscientious objector in the First World War, Forster served as a Chief Searcher (for missing servicemen) for the British Red Cross in Alexandria, Egypt. Though conscious of his repressed desires, it was only at this time, while stationed in Egypt, that he \"lost his R [respectability]\" to a wounded soldier in 1917.Forster spent a second spell in India in the early 1920s as private secretary to Tukojirao III, Maharajah of Dewas. The Hill of Devi is his non-fictional account of this period. After returning to London from India, he completed the last novel of his to be published in his lifetime, A Passage to India (1924), for which he won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. He also edited the letters of Eliza Fay (1756\u20131816) from India, in an edition first published in 1925. In 2012, Tim Leggatt, who knew Forster for his last 15 years, wrote a memoir using unpublished correspondence with him dating from those years.\nAfter A Passage to India\nForster was awarded a Benson Medal in 1937. In the 1930s and 1940s Forster became a notable broadcaster on BBC Radio, and while George Orwell was the BBC India Section talks producer from 1941 to 1943, he commissioned from Forster a weekly book review. Forster became publicly associated with the British Humanist Association. In addition to his broadcasting, he advocated individual liberty and penal reform and opposed censorship by writing articles, sitting on committees and signing letters. \nForster was open about his homosexuality to his close friends, but not to the public. He never married, but he had a number of male lovers during his adult life. He developed a long-term relationship with Bob Buckingham (1904\u20131975), a married policeman. Forster included Buckingham and his wife May in his circle, which included J. R. Ackerley, a writer and literary editor of The Listener, the psychologist W. J. H. Sprott, and for a time, the composer Benjamin Britten. Other writers with whom Forster associated included Christopher Isherwood, the poet Siegfried Sassoon, and the Belfast-based novelist Forrest Reid. He was a close friend of the socialist poet and philosopher Edward Carpenter, and it was a visit to Carpenter and his much younger lover George Merrill in 1913 that inspired Forster's novel Maurice, which is partly based on the couple.In 1960, Forster began a relationship with the Bulgarian emigre Mattei Radev, a picture framer and art collector who moved in Bloomsbury group circles. He was Forster's junior by 46 years. They met at Long Crichel House, a Georgian rectory in Long Crichel, Dorset, a country retreat shared by Edward Sackville-West and the gallery-owner and artist Eardley Knollys.\nFrom 1925 until his mother's death at age 90 in March 1945, Forster lived with her at the house West Hackhurst in the village of Abinger Hammer, Surrey, finally leaving in September 1946. His London base was 26 Brunswick Square from 1930 to 1939, after which he rented 9 Arlington Park Mansions in Chiswick until at least 1961. After a fall in April 1961, he spent his final years in Cambridge at King's College.Forster was elected an honorary fellow of King's College, Cambridge, in January 1946, and lived for the most part in the college, doing relatively little. In April 1947 he arrived in America to begin a three-month nationwide tour of public readings and sightseeing, returning to the East Coast in June. He declined a knighthood in 1949 and was made a Companion of Honour in 1953. At age 82, he wrote his last short story, Little Imber, a science fiction tale. According to his friend Richard Marquand, Forster was highly critical of American foreign policy in his latter years. This was one of the reasons why he consistently refused offers to adapt his novels for the screen, because Forster felt that such productions would inevitably involve American financing.At 85 he went on a pilgrimage to the Wiltshire countryside that had inspired his favourite novel The Longest Journey, escorted by William Golding. In 1969 he was made a member of the Order of Merit. Forster died of a stroke on 7 June 1970 at the age of 91, at the Buckinghams' home in Coventry, Warwickshire. His ashes, mingled with those of Buckingham, were later scattered in the rose garden of Coventry's crematorium, near Warwick University.\nNovels\nForster had five novels published in his lifetime. Although Maurice was published shortly after his death, it had been written nearly sixty years earlier. He never finished a seventh novel, Arctic Summer.\nHis first novel, Where Angels Fear to Tread (1905), is the story of Lilia, a young English widow who falls in love with an Italian, and of the efforts of her bourgeois relatives to get her back from Monteriano (based on San Gimignano). Philip Herriton's mission to retrieve her from Italy has features in common with that of Lambert Strether in Henry James's The Ambassadors. Forster discussed that work ironically and somewhat disapprovingly in his book Aspects of the Novel (1927). Where Angels Fear to Tread was adapted as a 1991 film directed by Charles Sturridge.\nNext, Forster published The Longest Journey (1907), an inverted Bildungsroman following the lame Rickie Elliott from Cambridge to a career as a struggling writer and then to a post as a schoolmaster, married to the unappealing Agnes Pembroke. In a series of scenes on the hills of Wiltshire, which introduce Rickie's wild half-brother Stephen Wonham, Forster attempts a kind of sublime related to those of Thomas Hardy and D. H. Lawrence.\n\nForster's third novel, A Room with a View (1908), is his lightest and most optimistic. It was started as early as 1901, before any of his others; its earliest versions are entitled Lucy. The book explores the young Lucy Honeychurch's trip to Italy with her cousin, and the choice she must make between the free-thinking George Emerson and the repressed aesthete Cecil Vyse. George's father Mr Emerson quotes thinkers who influenced Forster, including Samuel Butler. The book was adapted as a film of the same name in 1985 by the Merchant Ivory team, starring Helena Bonham Carter and Daniel Day-Lewis, and as a televised adaptation of the same name in 2007 by Andrew Davies.\nWhere Angels Fear to Tread and A Room with a View can be seen collectively as Forster's Italian novels. Both include references to the famous Baedeker guidebooks and concern narrow-minded middle-class English tourists abroad. The books share many themes with his short stories collected in The Celestial Omnibus and The Eternal Moment.\nHowards End (1910) is an ambitious \"condition-of-England\" novel concerned with different groups within the Edwardian middle classes, represented by the Schlegels (bohemian intellectuals), the Wilcoxes (thoughtless plutocrats) and the Basts (struggling lower-middle-class aspirants). Critics have observed that numerous characters in Forster's novels die suddenly. This is true of Where Angels Fear to Tread, Howards End and, most particularly, The Longest Journey. Howards End was adapted as a film in 1992 by the Merchant-Ivory team, starring Vanessa Redgrave, Emma Thompson, Anthony Hopkins, and Helena Bonham-Carter.  Emma Thompson would win the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Margaret Schlegel. It was also adapted as a miniseries in 2017. An opera libretto Howards End, America was created in 2016 by Claudia Stevens.\nForster achieved his greatest success with A Passage to India (1924). The novel takes as its subject the relationship between East and West, seen through the lens of India in the later days of the British Raj. Forster connects personal relationships with the politics of colonialism through the story of the Englishwoman Adela Quested, the Indian Dr. Aziz, and the question of what did or did not happen between them in the Marabar Caves. Forster makes special mention of the author Ahmed Ali and his Twilight in Delhi in his Preface to its Everyman's Library Edition. A Passage to India was adapted as a play in 1960, directed by Frank Hauser, and as a film in 1984, directed by David Lean.\nMaurice (1971) was published posthumously. It is a homosexual love story that also returns to matters familiar from Forster's first three novels, such as the suburbs of London in the English home counties, the experience of attending Cambridge, and the wild landscape of Wiltshire. The novel was controversial, given that Forster's homosexuality had not been previously known or widely acknowledged. Today's critics continue to argue over the extent to which Forster's sexuality and personal activities influenced his writing. Maurice was adapted as a film in 1987 by the Merchant Ivory team.\nEarly in his writing career, Forster attempted a historical novel about the Byzantine scholar Gemistus Pletho and the Italian condottiero Sigismondo de Malatesta, but was not satisfied with the result and never published it, though he kept the manuscript and later showed it to Naomi Mitchison.\nCritical reception\nForster's first novel, Where Angels Fear to Tread, was described by reviewers as \"astonishing\" and \"brilliantly original\". The Manchester Guardian (forerunner of The Guardian) noted \"a persistent vein of cynicism which is apt to repel,\" though \"the cynicism is not deep-seated.\" The novel is labelled \"a sordid comedy culminating, unexpectedly and with a real dramatic force, in a grotesque tragedy.\" Lionel Trilling remarked on this first novel as \"a whole and mature work dominated by a fresh and commanding intelligence\".Subsequent books were similarly received on publication. The Manchester Guardian commented on Howards End, describing it as \"a novel of high quality written with what appears to be a feminine brilliance of perception... witty and penetrating.\" An essay by David Cecil in Poets and Storytellers (1949) describes Forster as \"pulsing with intelligence and sensibility\", but primarily concerned with an original moral vision: \"He tells a story as well as anyone who ever lived\".US interest in Forster and appreciation for him were spurred by Lionel Trilling's E. M. Forster: A Study, which called him \"the only living novelist who can be read again and again and who, after each reading, gives me what few writers can give us after our first days of novel-reading, the sensation of having learned something.\" (Trilling 1943)\nCriticism of his works has included comment on unlikely pairings of characters who marry or get engaged, and the lack of realistic depiction of sexual attraction.\nKey themes\nForster was President of the Cambridge Humanists from 1959 until his death and a member of the Advisory Council of the British Humanist Association from 1963 until his death. His views as a humanist are at the heart of his work, which often depicts the pursuit of personal connections in spite of the restrictions of contemporary society. His humanist attitude is expressed in the 1938 non-fictional essay What I Believe (reprinted with two other humanist essays \u2013 and an introduction and notes by Nicolas Walter \u2013 as What I Believe, and other essays by the secular humanist publishers G. W. Foote & Co. in 1999). When Forster's cousin, Philip Whichelo, donated a portrait of Forster to the Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association (GLHA), Jim Herrick, the founder, quoted Forster's words: \"The humanist has four leading characteristics \u2013 curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race.\"\nForster's two best-known works, A Passage to India and Howards End, explore the irreconcilability of class differences. A Room with a View also shows how questions of propriety and class can make human connection difficult. The novel is his most widely read and accessible work, remaining popular long after its original publication. His posthumous novel Maurice explores the possibility of class reconciliation as one facet of a homosexual relationship.\nSexuality is another key theme in Forster's works. Some critics have argued that a general shift from heterosexual to homosexual love can be observed through the course of his writing career. The foreword to Maurice describes his struggle with his homosexuality, while he explored similar issues in several volumes of short stories. Forster's explicitly homosexual writings, the novel Maurice and the short story collection The Life to Come, were published shortly after his death.\nForster is noted for his use of symbolism as a technique in his novels, and he has been criticised (as by his friend Roger Fry) for his attachment to mysticism. One example of his symbolism is the wych elm tree in Howards End. The characters of Mrs Wilcox in that novel and Mrs Moore in A Passage to India have a mystical link with the past, and a striking ability to connect with people from beyond their own circles. Henry James, E. M. Forster and Somerset Maugham were the earliest fiction writers to portray characters from diverse countries \u2013 France, Germany, Italy and India. Their work explores cultural conflict, but arguably the motifs of humanism and cosmopolitanism are dominant. In a way this is anticipation of the concept of human beings shedding national identities and becoming more and more liberal and tolerant.\n\nNotable works by Forster\nNotable films and drama based upon Forster's fiction\nThe Machine Stops (1966), dramatised for the BBC anthology series Out of the Unknown\nA Passage to India (1984), dir.

Her work was integral to British Magazine The New Age which she helped edit along with her lover, A. R. Orage, prior to the outbreak of the First World War. Hastings was also friend and lover of Katherine Mansfield, whose work was first published in The New Age. She also had love affairs with Wyndham Lewis and Amedeo Modigliani.\nBiography\nBeatrice Hastings was born in London but grew up in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. She was educated in Pevensey, Sussex, near Hastings, which may have supplied her chosen name. From 1896 to 1899, she attended the University of Oxford to study Literature.\nIn 1907 she met A. R. Orage, the editor of The New Age magazine, with whom she embarked on a romantic relationship. Hastings soon began contributing to the magazine and went on to become one of its most prolific contributors, although most of her work appeared under pseudonyms. These include: Pagan, Alice Morning, A.M.A., E.H., B.L.H., Beatrice Tina, Cynicus, Robert a Field, T.K.L., D. Triformis, Edward Stafford, S. Robert West, V.M., G. Whiz, J. Wilson, Annette Doorly, Hastings Lloyd, Mrs. Malaprop, and T.W.Hastings' work for The New Age spanned many different forms and genres, including items of correspondence, parody, poetry, polemic, travel writing, prose fiction, and dramatic dialogue. She described herself in one instance as 'a minor poet of the first class.'. One of Hastings' greatest talents was parody, and she composed parodies of many her contemporaries, including Ezra Pound, Filippo Marinetti, and  H.G. Wells. Hastings was also outspoken in her feminist views and The New Age correspondence section provided the space in which she developed many of the ideas which would inform her 1909 feminist tract, Woman's Worst Enemy: Woman. \nIn 1914 Hastings moved to Paris and became a figure in bohemian circles due to her friendship with Max Jacob. She shared an apartment in Montparnasse with Amedeo Modigliani and became a model for countless paintings, including his 1916 Seated Nude. Another friend was adventure novelist Charles Beadle, with whom she had several things in common. He grew up in Hackney, spent time in South Africa (participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police), and published several novels about bohemian life in Paris. When Beadle came to America, from Paris, in November 1916, he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris.\nTowards the end of her life Hastings felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due, and blamed Orage, whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain. She published a pamphlet, The Old New Age (1936), in which she bitterly criticised Orage, calling him 'a rustic, a lout, a snob\u2019. Hastings claimed that she \u2018offended Orage\u2019s masculine amour-propre, and for this, was made the victim of a social cabale [\u2026] a literary boycott that does, or should, matter to every reading person\u2019. While many of the contents of this pamphlet are thought to be exaggerated, it nevertheless shines a light on Orage's already well-documented misogyny, and the experience of being a female author in the 1910s.\nIn 1943, probably suffering from cancer, she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker.\n\nPosthumous Recognition\nAlthough in her lifetime Hastings was regarded as a relatively minor literary figure, more recently she has been praised for her innovative use of pseudonyms and her pioneering feminist views.\nWallace Martin mentions her in his seminal study of The New Age, commenting that \u2018Beatrice Hastings displayed amazing versatility as reviewer, poet, and satirist; she was most effective, albeit unnecessarily malicious, in the last capacity.\u2019Literary critic Robert Scholes has noted that \"Hastings, who was an important presence on the New Age editorial staff before the war, had an unhappy life that ended in suicide, never receiving the recognition as a writer that she sought.\"\nTheosophy\nHastings was a convert to Theosophy. She attempted to defend Helena Blavatsky from charges of fraud and plagiarism. In 1937, she published two volumes entitled, Defence of Madame Blavatsky.Her writings on Theosophy have been criticized by skeptics. Biographer Peter Washington suggested that Hastings \"suffered from delusions of literary grandeur.\"\nPublications\nWoman's Worst Enemy \u2013 Woman, 1909\nThe Maids' Comedy: A Chivalric Romance in Thirteen Chapters, 1911\nThe Old \"New Age\"\u2014Orage and Others, Blue Moon Press, 1935\nDefence of Madame Blavatsky (Volume 1, Volume 2), Hastings Press, 1937References\nFurther reading\nCarswell, John, Lives and Letters, New York, New Directions, 1978.\nGray, Stephen (1999). \"Beatrice Hastings\".

She strongly supported women's rights, racial equality, and lifelong education. Eleanor Roosevelt named her one of the ten most influential women in the United States. In addition to bringing the Montessori method of child-rearing to the U.S., she presided over the country's first adult education program and shaped literary tastes by serving as a member of the Book of the Month Club selection committee from 1925 to 1951.\n\nBiography\nDorothea Frances Canfield \u2013 named for Dorothea Brooke of the novel Middlemarch \u2013 was born on February 17, 1879 in Lawrence, Kansas to James Hulme Canfield and Flavia Camp, an artist and writer. From 1877 to 1891 her father was a [University of Kansas professor with responsibility for various historical studies, and finally president of the National Education Association. Later he was chancellor of the University of Nebraska, president of Ohio State University, and librarian at Columbia University. Canfield Fisher is most closely associated with Vermont, where she and her mother made trips to the family home and where she spent her adult life. Vermont also served as the setting for many of her books.\nIn 1899 Canfield received a B.A. from Ohio State University, where she was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma. She went on to study Romance languages at University of Paris and Columbia University (where her father was Librarian from 1899) and earned a doctoral degree from Columbia with the dissertation Corneille and Racine in English (1904). With George Rice Carpenter from Columbia she co-wrote English Rhetoric and Composition (1906). She was the first woman to receive an honorary degree from Dartmouth College and received others from the University of Nebraska, Middlebury College, Swarthmore College, Smith College, Williams College, Ohio State University, and the University of Vermont.She married John Redwood Fisher in 1907, and they had two children, a daughter, Sally, and a son, Jimmy.In 1911, Canfield Fisher visited the \"children's houses\" in Rome established by Maria Montessori. Much impressed, she joined the cause to bring the method back to the U.S., translating Montessori's book into English and writing five of her own: three nonfiction and two novels.Another concern of Canfield Fisher was her war work. She followed her husband to France in 1916 during World War I and while raising her young children in Paris worked to establish a Braille press for blinded veterans. She also established a convalescent home for refugee French children from the invaded areas; continuing her relief work after the war, she earned citations of appreciation from Eleanor Roosevelt, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, and the government of Denmark.Canfield Fisher died at the age of 79 in Arlington, Vermont in 1958.\nActivism\nCanfield Fisher engaged in social activism in many aspects of education and politics. She managed the first adult education program in the U.S. She did war-relief work in 1917 in France, establishing the Bidart Home for Children for refugees and organizing an effort to print books in Braille for blinded combat veterans. In 1919, she was appointed to the State Board of Education of Vermont to help improve rural public education. She spent years promoting education and rehabilitation\/reform in prisons, especially women's prisons.After the war, she was the head of the U.S. committee that led to the pardoning of conscientious objectors in 1921, and sponsored financial and emigration assistance to Jewish educators, professionals, and intellectuals.After her son was killed in World War II, she arranged a fellowship at Harvard Medical School for the two Philippine surgeons who tried to save his life.\nControversy\nIn 2017, an Abenaki educator lobbied the Vermont Department of Libraries to pull Fisher's name from the children's literature award created in the state over half a century ago to honor her. Judy Dow claimed that Fisher stereotyped French Canadians and Native Americans in her works of fiction, and that she may have been part of the eugenics movement that promoted cleansing Vermont of people considered genetically less desirable in the 1920s and 1930s. Other voices discussed putting Fisher's characterizations in context of the times in which she lived. Yet others suggested that because Fisher's works are no longer widely read nor is her name well recognized, perhaps it has become time to retire the title of the literature award. No direct connection with the eugenics movement has been established. The Vermont State Board of Libraries recommended dropping her name from the award on grounds that \"it was no longer relevant to today's young people\". The state librarian announced in 2019 that the award would receive a new name for 2020.\nAffiliations\nCanfield Fisher and Willa Cather's decades-long relationship intensely revolved around their writing. Their letters, from 1899 to 1947, reveal a lasting and complicated friendship.Cather wrote a short story that may have satirized Canfield's mother, called \"Flavia and Her Artists\"\u2014sparking ten years of interrupted friendship between Canfield Fisher and Cather.\nOther writers who corresponded with Canfield Fisher included Henry Seidel Canby, Richard Wright, Heywood Broun, Witter Bynner, Isak Dinesen, and Robert Frost.\nCanfield Fisher worked with the following organizations over the course of her life.\n\nAdult Education Association\nAmerican Youth Commission of the American Council of Education, 1936\u20131940\nBook of the Month Club Committee of Selection, 1926 until 1951\nHonorary Committee of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, 1935\nThe Lighthouse Organization, 1917\nNational Institute of Arts and Letters, 1931\nVermont Board of Education, 1921Children\nSally was born in 1909. When her mother died in 1958, Mrs. John Paul Scott lived in Bar Harbor, Maine and had written 18 children's books as Sally Scott. Canfield Fisher's granddaughter Vivian Scott was also writing children's books and at least one had been published, evidently.\nJames (Jimmy) was born in 1913 and became a surgeon and captain in the U.S. Army during World War II. He served with the Alamo Scouts for three months at the end of 1944, following which he was attached to a Ranger unit which carried out the raid to free POWs imprisoned at Cabanatuan in the Philippines.\nThe Raid at Cabanatuan was a great success, with the Rangers suffering only two fatalities. Captain Fisher was one, mortally wounded by a mortar shell. As he lay dying the next day, his last words were \"Did we get them all out?\" He died on Luzon, January 31, 1945.\nLegacy\nThe Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award is an award for new American children's books whose winner is chosen by the vote of child readers.A dormitory at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont is named for Fisher.\n\nWorks\nBooks\nCanfield Fisher spoke five languages fluently, and in addition to writing novels, short stories, memoirs, and educational works, she wrote extensively as a literary critic and translator. For tax purposes, her novels were written as \"Canfield,\" her non-fiction as \"Fisher.\"Her best-known work today is probably Understood Betsy, a children's book about a little orphaned girl who is sent to live with her cousins in Vermont. Although the book can be read purely for pleasure, it also describes a schoolhouse which is run much in the style of the Montessori method. Another of her books, The Home-maker, was reprinted by Anita Miller's Academy Chicago Publishers calling it \"way ahead of its time.\" In all, she wrote 22 novels and 18 works of non-fiction.William Lyon Phelps said \"All her novels are autobiographical, being written exclusively out of her own experience and observation.\"\nNovels\nGunhild (1907) (contrasting Norwegian and American values)\nThe Squirrel-Cage (1912) (the first of her treatments of marriage)\nThe Bent Twig (1915)\nThe Real Motive (1916).\nFellow Captains  (1916) (with Sarah N.

In 1896 he joined the English department of the Tokyo Senmon Gakko (now Waseda University). He was baptized as a Christian by priest Uemura Masahisa in 1897. After graduation, he worked in the university's Publishing Department, then in 1903 began writing literary, art, and cultural criticism for the Yomiuri Shinbun newspaper. In 1904 he published his first novel, Sekibaku (Solitude), in the Shinshosetsu literary magazine, Jin\u2019ai (Dust) in 1907, and gained attention with a naturalist novel, Doko-e (Whither?), published in serial form in Waseda bungaku through 1908. He left the newspaper in 1910 to become a full-time author, and in 1911 his novel Doro ningy\u014d (The Mud Doll) gained further acclaim.\nAlthough Masamune is perhaps most remembered for his criticism, he wrote a variety of works throughout his career, including short stories, dramas, and literary criticism. Major novels include Ushibeya no nioi (The Stench of the Stable, 1916) and Shisha seisha (The Dead and the Living, 1916); his best known plays are perhaps Jinsei no k\u014dfuku (The Happiness of Human Life, 1924) and Tenshi hokaku (Captive Angels, 1947); and outstanding examples of his criticism include Bundan jimbutsu hy\u014dron (Critical Essays on Literary Figures), Shis\u014d mushis\u014d (Thought and Non-Thought, 1938), Bundanteki jijoden (A Literary Autobiography, 1938), Sakka ron (A Study of Writers, 1941-2), Shizenshugi seisuishi (The Rise and Fall of Naturalism, 1948), and Uchimura Kanz\u014d (1949).\nMasamune received the 1959 Yomiuri Prize in literature for Kotoshi no aki.\n\nReferences\nRobert Rolf, Masamune Hakuch\u014d, Twayne Publishers, G.

According to prominent historian Ann Waswo, Nagatsuka Takashi was born into a landowning family.\nGenerally, he was born in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. More specifically, his place of birth was \u56fd\u751f\u6751 (Kossh\u014d Village) in \u77f3\u4e0b\u753a (Ishige Town), which was merged in 2006 with \u6c34\u6d77\u9053\u5e02 (Mitsukaido City) to form modern day \u5e38\u7dcf\u5e02 (Joso City).\nIn 1896, poor health forced him to stop his middle-school education in Mito. In accordance with his duties as eldest son, he assisted his mother Taka in managing their six acres of arable land. He started experimenting in 1905 with different fertilizers, crop-rotation, charcoal-production, and commercial-grade bamboo-production. These are just some of his attempts to save the family's finances from the political career of his father Genjiro (who was elected during the late 1880s to the prefectural assembly), since he tended to absorb other people's debts.\nIn Tokyo, he studied poetry with Masaoka Shiki starting 1900 until 1902, the same year Shiki died of tuberculosis.His only novel \u571f (\"Tsuchi\"; \"The Soil\") was published in 151-installment series from June\u2013November of1910 in the \u6771\u4eac\u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e (Tokyo Asahi Shimbun; Tokyo Morning-Sun Newspaper), which eventually became today's \u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e (Asahi Shimbun\u00a0; Morning-Sun Newspaper) after a merger with the \u5927\u962a\u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e (Osaka Asahi Shimbun; Osaka Morning-Sun Newspaper). Two years after its newspaper serialization, \u571f was published as a complete work in book form in 1912. The novel depicts life in rural Japan and in Kossho Village. The characters are based on actual people although their names are altered. The novel's copyright expired in the mid-1960s.\nHe died of laryngeal  tuberculosis on February 8, 1915.\n\nMajor works\n\u3057\u3089\u304f\u3061\u306e\u82b1 Shirakuchi no hana\n\u70ad\u713c\u306e\u3080\u3059\u3081 Sumiyaki no musume\n\u592a\u5341\u3068\u5176\u72ac Tajuu to sono inu\n\u9577\u585a\u7bc0\u6b4c\u96c6 Nagatsuka Takashi Kashu, tanka collection\n\u96a3\u5ba4\u306e\u5ba2 Rinshitsu no kyaku\n\u571f Tsuchi\nThe Soil, translated by Ann Waswo, University of California Press, 1989, ISBN\u00a09780520083721References\nSee also\nJapanese literature\nList of Japanese authorsExternal links\nWorks by or about Takashi Nagatsuka at Internet Archive\nWorks by Takashi Nagatsuka at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \n\n\n","92":"John Erskine (October 5, 1879 \u2013 June 2, 1951) was an American educator and author, pianist and composer. He was an English professor at Amherst College from 1903 to 1909, followed by Columbia University from 1909 to 1937. He was the first president of the Juilliard School of Music.  During his tenure at Columbia University he formulated the General Honors Course\u2014responsible for inspiring the influential Great Books movement. He published over 100 books, novels, criticism, and essays including his most important essay, The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent (1915).\n\nEarly life and education\nErskine was born in New York City, New York, the son of Eliza Jane (n\u00e9e Hollingsworth) and James Morrison Erskine. and raised in Weehawken, New Jersey. He graduated from Columbia University, B.A., 1900, M.A. 1901 and Ph. D., 1903 and D. Litt. 1929, besides D. Litt. degree from Amherst in 1923.\nCareer\nProfessor Erskine was English professor at Amherst College from 1903 to 1909, and subsequently taught at Columbia University from 1909 to 1937. In 1910, he led foundation of the Boar's Head Society for literature.  In 1920, he instituted Columbia College's General Honors Course, a two-year undergraduate seminar that would later help inspire \"Masterworks of Western Literature,\" now known commonly as \"Literature Humanities,\" the second component of Columbia College's Core Curriculum. This course taught the classics in translation instead of the original Latin or Greek, a concept he elaborated in his noted essay  The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent. He found little support for the course from the senior faculty, and junior faculty members like Mark Van Doren and later after 1923, Mortimer Adler took up sections of the course. This course would later go on to inspire the Great Books movement, centered on the Great Books of the Western World. The course was discontinued in 1928, though later reconstituted. In 1929, Adler left Columbia to join University of Chicago, where he continued to work on the theme with Robert Hutchins, President of the University. Together they subsequently went on to found the Great Books of the Western World program and the Great Books Foundation.Erskine co-wrote the 1900 Varsity Show at Columbia, writing the musical score for The Governor's Vrouw (1900), a two-act comic opera by Henry Sydnor Harrison and poet Melville Cane, who also wrote the lyrics. He won the Butler Medal in 1919. During his career Erskine published over 100 books, though as a writer he first received acclaim with his novel The Private Life of Helen of Troy (1925). This novel was made into a silent film by the same the name in 1927, directed by Alexander Korda. Other films based on his works included A Lady Surrenders (1930) by John M. Stahl, Bachelor of Arts (1934) by Louis King and The President's Mystery (1936) directed by Phil Rosen. The 1956 biopic of French noblewoman Diane de Poitiers entitled Diane was based on his story with a screenplay by Christopher Isherwood. He was also the author of numerous publications, including several humorous novels retelling myths and legends, besides essays, criticism, and two volumes of autobiography. These included Penelope's Man and Adam and Eve, Though He Knew Better.Erskine was also an accomplished composer, pianist and musician. He wrote several books of music and the libretto for George Antheil's opera Helen Retires (1931), which was based on The Private Life of Helen of Troy. He was the first president of the Juilliard School of Music from 1928 to 1937. He was also director of the Metropolitan Opera Association, which runs the Metropolitan Opera, a noted opera company based in New York City.Erskine is also credited with writing the subtitles for a number of films, including Sacha Guitry's Le Roman d'un tricheur (The Story of a Cheat) in 1938, Marcel Pagnol's The Baker's Wife in 1940 and Mario Camerini's The Spirit and the Flesh, an adaptation of Alessandro Manzoni's classic novel The Betrothed, in 1948.To commemorate the seven hundredth anniversary of Roger Bacon, Erskine wrote A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century, a biographical play which was produced at Columbia University and published as a book by Columbia University Press in 1914. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a collection of his papers. In 1946 he served as the first chairman of the American Writers Association.\nPersonal life\nHe was married twice to Pauline Ives (m. 1910\u20131945) and Helen Worden Erskine (m. 1946\u20131951). With his wife Pauline (Ives), he was the grandfather of actress Lindsay Crouse and the great-grandfather of actress Zosia Mamet.

He kept his mother's name as his nome de plume. In 1888 he moved with his parents to Marseille and stayed there until 1898, studying at the Jesuit College of St. Ignatius in Marseille. At the same time he befriended a group of young writers. In 1894 they founded a magazine la Revue M\u00e9diterran\u00e9enne in which he published his early work. In 1900 he met Camille Mockler in Saint-Leu-La-For\u00eat.\nIn 1904 Miomandre published his first book \"Thoughts and memories\" with a circulation of two hundred and twenty copies. He worked with the magazine \u00ab\u00a0le Mercure de France\u00a0\u00bb (Paris) \u00abAnt\u00e9e\u00bb (Bruges) and \u00abL'Occident\u00bb. Francis began to sell paintings at a gallery called Berngayma, and later worked as a secretary to his director - F\u00e9lix F\u00e9n\u00e9on. Later, he served as secretary of the editorial board of the journal \u00abL'Art et les artistes\u00bb until 1912. He eventually won the Prix Goncourt in 1908 for his novel \u00c9crit sur l'eau.... His novels are highly imaginative and put together with the genuine talent of a romancer who has traveled far and wide at his own study table.\nMiomandre wrote thousands of articles for over two hundred magazines and newspapers. This work was his main livelihood. From time to time wrote in the edition Marges, New French Review, Manuscrit autographe and les Cahiers du Sud, and he had a column in the chronicle Nouvelles litt\u00e9raires from 1922 until his death in 1959. In addition, in 1926, he regularly wrote literary critiques, and collaborated with other magazines. His first critical essays were published in the book \"The Face\" in 1907. Four years later, he released another collection of essays.\nAt the same time, he became one of the foremost translators of Spanish. In 1918 Miomandre released \"Selected pages\" by Jose Enrique Rodo, in 1921 - \"Twenty-four sonnets\" by Luis de Gongora-and-Argote. Among the authors who Miomandre translated were Miguel de Unamuno, Ventura Garcia Calderon, Miguel de Cervantes, Miguel Angel Asturias, Lydia Cabrera, Horacio Quiroga, Benito Perez Galdos, Enrique Rodr\u00edguez Larreta, Lazcano Tags Eugenio d'Orsay, Joaquin Maria Machado de Assis, Jose Marti and others. There are about fifty translated works.\nMiomandre wrote articles for many Spanish and Latin American editions, and from 1946 to 1956 was editor of the category \"Iberian Literature\" for the magazine \u00abHommes et Mondes\u00bb. According to Claude Kuffona, every morning Miomandre translated ten pages of text, and in the afternoon and evening worked on critical articles or his own literary works. He wrote easily and critics overwhelmingly recognized the lightness and clarity of his language.\nMiomandre also acted as a screenwriter. In 1923 he wrote the screenplay for the film \"Shelter of Love, or The Return of Uncle Arsene,\" based on his novel of the same name.\nFrom 1908 to 1911, he participated in the Club des longues moustaches (Club of long whiskers).\n\nWorks\nNovels\n\u00c9crit sur de l'eau...

He was a leading figure of modern Chinese literature. Writing in Vernacular Chinese and Classical Chinese, he was a short story writer, editor, translator, literary critic, essayist, poet, and designer. In the 1930s, he became the titular head of the League of Left-Wing Writers in Shanghai.\nLu Xun was born into a family of landlords and government officials in Shaoxing, Zhejiang; the family's financial resources declined over the course of his youth. Lu aspired to take the imperial civil service exam, but due to his family's relative poverty he was forced to attend government-funded schools teaching \"Western education.\" Upon graduation, Lu went to medical school in Japan but later dropped out. He became interested in studying literature but was eventually forced to return to China because of his family's lack of funds. After returning to China, Lu worked for several years teaching at local secondary schools and colleges before finally finding a job at the Republic of China Ministry of Education.\nAfter the 1919 May Fourth Movement, Lu Xun's writing began to exert a substantial influence on Chinese literature and popular culture. Like many leaders of the May Fourth Movement, he was primarily a leftist. He was highly acclaimed by the Chinese government after 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, and Mao Zedong himself was a lifelong admirer of Lu Xun's writing. Though sympathetic to socialist ideals, Lu Xun never joined the Communist Party of China.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nLu Xun was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. As was common in pre-modern China, Lu Xun had many names. His birth name was \"Zhou Zhangshou\" (Chinese: \u5468\u6a1f\u58fd; pinyin: Zh\u014du Zh\u0101ngsh\u00f2u). His courtesy name was \"Yushan\" (Chinese: \u8c6b\u5c71; pinyin: Y\u00f9sh\u0101n), but he later changed that to \"Yucai\" (Chinese: \u8c6b\u624d; pinyin: Y\u00f9c\u00e1i). In 1898, before he went to the Jiangnan Naval Academy, he took the given name \"Shuren\" (Chinese: \u6a39\u4eba; pinyin: Sh\u00f9r\u00e9n)\u2014which means, figuratively, \"to be an educated man\". The name by which he is best known internationally, \"Lu Xun\", was a literary pseudonym that he chose when his fiction novel \"A Madman's Diary\" was first published, in 1918.By the time Lu Xun was born, the Zhou family had been prosperous for centuries, and had become wealthy through landowning, pawnbroking, and by having several family members promoted to government positions. His paternal grandfather, Zhou Fuqing, was appointed to the Imperial Hanlin Academy in Beijing: the highest position possible for aspiring civil servants at that time. Lu's early education was based on the Confucian classics, in which he studied poetry, history, and philosophy\u2014subjects which, he later reflected, were neither useful nor interesting to him. Instead, he enjoyed folk stories and traditions: local operas, the mythological creatures and stories in the Classic of Mountains and Seas, and the ghost stories told to him by an illiterate servant who raised him, Ah Chang (whom he called \"Mother Chang\"). Zhou's mother was a member of the same landed gentry class as Lu Xun's father, from a slightly smaller town in the countryside (Anqiaotou, Zhejiang; a part of Tongxiang City). Because formal education was not considered socially appropriate for girls, She had not received any education, but she still taught herself how to read and write. The surname \"Lu (\u9b6f)\" in Zhou Shouren's pen name, \"Lu Xun\", was the same as his mother's surname, \"Lu\".By the time Lu was born, his family's prosperity had already been declining. His father, Zhou Boyi, had been successful at passing the lowest, county-level imperial examinations (the route to wealth and social success in imperial China), but was unsuccessful in writing the more competitive provincial-level examinations (the juren exam). In 1893 Zhou Boyi was discovered attempting to bribe an examination official. Lu Xun's grandfather was implicated, and was arrested and sentenced to beheading for his son's crime. The sentence was later commuted, and he was imprisoned in Hangzhou instead. After the affair, Zhou Boyi was stripped of his position in the government and forbidden to ever again write the civil service examinations. The Zhou family only prevented Lu's grandfather from being executed through regular, expensive bribes to authorities, until he was finally released in 1901.After the family's attempt at bribery was discovered, Zhou Boyi engaged in heavy drinking and opium use, and his health declined. Local Chinese doctors attempted to cure him through a series of expensive quack prescriptions, including monogamous crickets, sugar cane that had survived frost three times, ink, and the skin from a drum. Despite these expensive treatments, Zhou Boyi died of an asthma attack at age 35 in 1896. He might have suffered from dropsy.\nEducation\nLu Xun half-heartedly participated in one civil service examination, in 1899, but then abandoned pursuing a traditional Confucian education or career. He intended to study at a prestigious school, the \"Seeking Affirmation Academy\", in Hangzhou, but was forced by his family's poverty to study at a tuition-free military school, the \"Jiangnan Naval Academy\", in Nanjing, instead. As a consequence of Lu's decision to attend a military school specializing in Western education, his mother wept, he was instructed to change his name (to avoid disgracing his family), and some of his relatives began to look down on him. Lu attended the Jiangnan Naval Academy for half a year, and left after it became clear that he would be assigned to work in an engine room, below deck, which he considered degrading. He later wrote that he was dissatisfied with the quality of teaching at the academy. After leaving the school, Lu sat for the lowest level of the civil service exams, and finished 137th of 500. He intended to sit for the next-highest level, but became upset when one of his younger brothers died, and abandoned his plans.Lu Xun transferred to another government-funded school, the \"School of Mines and Railways\", and graduated from that school in 1902. The school was Lu's first exposure to Western literature, philosophy, history, and science, and he studied English and German intensively. Some of the influential authors that he read during that period include T. H. Huxley, John Stuart Mill, Yan Fu, and Liang Qichao. His later social philosophy may have been influenced by several novels about social conflict that he read during the period, including Ivanhoe and Uncle Tom's Cabin.He did very well at the school with relatively little effort, and occasionally experienced racism directed at him from resident Manchu bannermen. The racism he experienced may have influenced his later sense of Han Chinese nationalism. After graduating Lu Xun planned to become a Western doctor.In 1902, Lu Xun left for Japan on a Qing government scholarship to pursue an education in Western medicine. After arriving in Japan he attended the \"Kobun Institute\", a preparatory language school for Chinese students attending Japanese universities. After encouragement from a classmate, he cut off his queue (which all Han Chinese were legally forced to wear in China) and practiced jujutsu in his free time. He had an ambiguous attitude towards Chinese revolutionary politics during the period, and it is not clear whether he joined any of the revolutionary parties (such as the Tongmenghui) that were popular among Chinese expatriates in Japan at that time. He experienced anti-Chinese racism, but was simultaneously disgusted with the behaviour of some Chinese who were living in Japan. His earliest surviving essays, written in Classical Chinese, were published while he was attending this school, and he published his first Chinese translations of famous and influential Western novels, including Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.In 1904, Lu began studying at the Sendai Medical Academy, in northern Honshu, but remained there for less than two years. He generally found his studies at the school tedious and difficult, partially due to his imperfect Japanese. While studying in Sendai he befriended one of his professors, Fujino Genkur\u014d, who helped him prepare class notes. Because of their friendship Lu was accused by his classmates of receiving special assistance from Fujino. Lu later recalled his mentor respectfully and affectionately in an essay, \"Mr Fujino\", published in Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk. This essay, today one of his most publicly renowned works, is in the middle school literature curriculum in China. Fujino later repaid Lu's respect in an obituary essay on his death, in 1937. The Sendai Medical Academy is now the medical school of Tohoku University.\n\nWhile Lu Xun was attending medical school, the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905) broke out. Part of the war was fought on disputed Chinese land. While the war was being fought it became common for lecturers to show slides of pictures from the war to their students after their classes had ended. After one of his biology classes Lu was shown a scene in which a Japanese soldier was about to behead a Chinese man who had allegedly spied for the Russians, surrounded by Chinese who were apathetic to the scene. In his preface to Nahan, the first collection of his short stories, Lu explained how viewing this scene influenced him to quit studying Western medicine, and to become a literary physician to what he perceived to be China's spiritual problems instead:\nAt the time, I hadn't seen any of my fellow Chinese in a long time, but one day some of them showed up in a slide. One, with his hands tied behind him, was in the middle of the picture; the others were gathered around him. Physically, they were as strong and healthy as anyone could ask, but their expressions revealed all too clearly that spiritually they were calloused and numb. According to the caption, the Chinese whose hands were bound had been spying on the Japanese military for the Russians. He was about to be decapitated as a 'public example.' The other Chinese gathered around him had come to enjoy the spectacle.\nIn March 1906, Lu Xun abruptly and secretly terminated his pursuit of the degree and left college. At the time he told no one. After arriving in Tokyo he made sure that the Chinese embassy would not cancel his scholarship and registered at the local German Institute, but was not required to take classes there. He began to read Nietzsche, and wrote a number of essays in the period that were influenced by his philosophy.In June 1906, Lu's mother heard a rumor that he had married a Japanese girl and had a child with her, and feigned illness as a pretext to ask Lu to return home, where she would then force him to take part in an arranged marriage she had agreed to several years before. The girl, Zhu An, had little in common with Lu, was illiterate, and had bound feet. Lu Xun married her, but they never had a romantic relationship. Despite that fact, Lu took care of her material needs for the rest of his life. Several days after the ceremony Lu sailed back to Japan with his younger brother, Zuoren, and left behind his new wife.After returning to Japan he took informal classes in literature and history, published several essays in student-run journals, and in 1907 he briefly took Russian lessons. He attempted to found a literary journal with his brother, New Life, but before its first publication its other writers and its financial backers all abandoned the project, and it failed. In 1909 Lu published a translation of Eastern European fiction, Tales from Abroad, but the book sold only 41 copies of the 1,500 copies that were printed. The publication failed for many reasons: it was sold only in Tokyo (which did not have a large Chinese population) and a single silk shop in Shanghai; Chinese readers may not have been interested in Eastern European culture; and, Lu wrote in Classical Chinese, which was very difficult for ordinary people to read.\nEarly career\nLu intended to study in Germany in 1909, but did not have sufficient funds, and was forced to return home. Between 1909 and 1911 he held a number of brief teaching positions at local colleges and secondary schools that he felt were unsatisfying, partly to support his brother Zuoren's studies in Japan.Lu spent these years in traditional Chinese literary pursuits: collecting old books, researching pre-modern Chinese fiction, reconstructing ancient tombstone inscriptions, and compiling the history of his native town, Shaoxing. He explained to an old friend that his activities were not \"scholarship\", but \"a substitute for 'wine and women'\". In his personal letters he expressed disappointment about his own failure, China's political situation, and his family's continuing impoverishment. In 1911 he returned to Japan to retrieve his brother, Zuoren, so that Zuoren could help with the family finances. Zuoren wanted to remain in Japan to study French, but Lu wrote that \"French... does not fill stomachs.\" He encouraged another brother, Jianren, to become a botanist. He began to drink heavily, a habit he continued for the rest of his life. In 1911 he wrote his first short story, Nostalgia, but he was so disappointed with it that he threw it away. Zuoren saved it, and had it successfully published two years later under his own name.In February 1912, shortly after the Xinhai Revolution that ended the Qing dynasty and nominally founded the Republic of China, Lu gained a position at the national Ministry of Education. He was hired in Nanjing, but then moved with the ministry to Beijing, where he lived from 1912 to 1926. At first, his work consisted almost completely of copying books, but he was later appointed Section Head of the Social Education Division, and eventually to the position of Assistant Secretary. Two of his major accomplishments in office were the renovation and expansion of the Beijing Library, the establishment of the Natural History Museum, and the establishment of the Library of Popular Literature.Together with Qian Daosun and Xu Shoushang he designed the Twelve Symbols national emblem in 1912.\nBetween 1912 and 1917 he was a member of an ineffectual censorship committee, informally studied Buddhist sutras, lectured on fine arts, wrote and self-published a book on the history of Shaoxing, and edited and self-published a collection of folk stories from the Tang and Song dynasty. He collected and self-published an authoritative book on the work of an ancient poet, Ji Kang, and wrote A Brief History of Chinese Fiction, a work which, because traditional scholars had not valued fiction, had little precedent in China. After Yuan Shikai declared himself the Emperor of China in 1915, Lu was briefly forced to participate in rituals honoring Confucius, which he ridiculed in his diaries.In 1917, an old friend of Lu's, Qian Xuantong, invited Lu to write for New Youth, a radical populist literary magazine that had recently been founded by Chen Duxiu, which also inspired a great number of younger writers such as Mao Dun. At first Lu was skeptical that his writing could serve any social purpose, and told Qian: \"Imagine an iron house: without windows or doors, utterly indestructible, and full of sound sleepers \u2013 all about to suffocate to death. Let them die in their sleep, and they will feel nothing. Is it right to cry out, to rouse the light sleepers among them, causing them inconsolable agony before they die?\" Qian replied that it was, because if the sleepers were awoken, \"there was still hope \u2013 hope that the iron house may one day be destroyed\". Shortly afterwards, in 1918 Lu wrote the first short story published in his name, Diary of a Madman, for the magazine.After the publication of Diary of a Madman, the story was praised for its anti-traditionalism, its synthesis of Chinese and foreign conventions and ideas, and its skillful narration, and Lu became recognized as one of the leading writers of the New Culture Movement. Lu continued writing for the magazine, and produced his most famous stories for New Youth between 1917 and 1921. These stories were collected and re-published in Nahan (\"Outcry\") in 1923.In 1919, Lu moved his family from Shaoxing to a large compound in Beijing, where he lived with his mother, his two brothers, and their Japanese wives. This living arrangement lasted until 1923, when Lu had a falling out with his brother, Zuoren, after which Lu moved with his wife and mother to a separate house. Neither Lu nor Zuoren ever publicly explained the reason for their disagreement, but Zuoren's wife later accused Lu of making sexual advances towards her. Some writers have speculated that their relationship may have worsened as a result of issues related to money, that Lu walked in on Zuoren's wife bathing, or that Lu had an inappropriate \"relationship\" with Zuoren's wife in Japan that Zuoren later discovered. After the falling out with Zuoren, Lu became depressed.In 1920, Lu began to lecture part-time at several colleges, including Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing Women's College, where he taught traditional fiction and literary theory. His lecture notes were later collected and published as a A Brief History of Chinese Fiction. He was able to work part-time because he only worked at the Education Ministry three days a week for three hours a day. In 1923 he lost his front teeth in a rickshaw accident, and in 1924 he developed the first symptoms of tuberculosis. In 1925 he founded a journal, Wilderness, and established the \"Weiming Society\" in order to support young writers and encourage the translation of foreign literature into Chinese.In the 20 years after the 1911 revolution there was a flowering of literary activity with dozens of journals. The goal was to reform the Chinese language to make universal education possible. Lu Xun was an active participant. His greatest works like Mad Man's Diary and Ah Q exemplify this style of \"peasant dirt literarature\" \u4e61\u571f\u6587\u5b66. The language is fresh and direct. The subjects are country peasants.\nIn 1925, Lu began what may have been his first meaningful romantic relationship, with one of his students at the Beijing Women's College, Xu Guangping. In March 1926 there was a mass student protest against the warlord Feng Yuxiang's collaboration with the Japanese. The protests degenerated into a massacre, in which two of Lu's students from Beijing Women's College were killed. Lu's public support for the protesters forced him to flee from the local authorities. Later in 1926, when the warlord troops of Zhang Zuolin and Wu Peifu took over Beijing, Lu left northern China and fled to Xiamen.After arriving in Xiamen, later in 1926, Lu began a teaching position at Xiamen University, but he was disappointed by the petty disagreements and unfriendliness of the university's faculty. During the short time he lived in Xiamen, Lu wrote his last collection of fiction, Old Tales Retold (which was not published until several years later), and most of his autobiography, published as Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk. He also published a collection of prose poetry, Wild Grass.In January 1927, he and Xu moved to Guangzhou, where he was hired as the head of the Zhongshan University Chinese literature department. His first act in his position was to hire Xu as his \"personal assistant\", and to hire one of his old classmates from Japan, Xu Shoushang, as a lecturer. While in Guangzhou, he edited numerous poems and books for publication, and served as a guest lecturer at Whampoa Academy. He made contacts within the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party through his students. After the Shanghai massacre in April 1927, he attempted to secure the release of several students through the university, but failed. His failure to save his students led him to resign from his position at the university, and he left for the Shanghai International Settlement in September 1927. By the time he left Guangzhou, he was one of the most famous intellectuals in China.In 1927 Lu was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature, for the short story The True Story of Ah Q, despite a poor English translation and annotations that were nearly double the size of the text. Lu rejected the possibility of accepting the nomination. Later, he renounced writing fiction or poetry in response to China's deteriorating political situation and his own poor emotional state, and restricted himself to writing argumentative essays.\nLate career\nIn 1929, he visited his dying mother, and reported that she was pleased at the news of Guangping's pregnancy. Xu Guangping gave birth to a son, Haiying, on 27 September 1929. She was in labor with the baby for 27 hours. The child's name meant simply \"Shanghai infant\". His parents chose the name thinking that he could change it himself later, but he never did so. Haiying was Lu Xun's only child.After moving to Shanghai, Lu rejected all regular teaching positions (though he sometimes gave guest lectures at different campuses), and for the first time was able to make a living solely as a professional writer, with a monthly income of roughly 500 yuan. He was also appointed by the government as a \"specially appointed writer\" by the national Ministry of Higher Education, which brought him an additional 300 yuan\/month. He began to study and identify with Marxist political theory, made contact with local Communist Party members, and became involved in literary disputes with other leftist writers in the city. In 1930 Lu became one of the co-founders of the League of Left-Wing Writers, but shortly after he moved to Shanghai other leftist writers accused him of being \"an evil feudal remnant\", the \"best spokesman of the bourgeoisie\", and \"a counterrevolutionary split personality\". The CCP may have secretly initiated these attacks, but later called them off. The League continued in various forms until 1936, when the constant disputes among its members led the CCP to dissolve it.In January 1931, the Kuomintang passed new, stricter censorship laws, allowing for writers producing literature deemed \"endangering the public\" or \"disturbing public order\" to be imprisoned for life or executed. Later that month he went into hiding. In early February, less than a month later, the Kuomintang executed twenty-four local writers (including five that belonged to the League) that they had arrested under this law. After the execution of the \"24 Longhua Martyrs\" (in addition to other students, friends, and associates), Lu's political views became distinctly anti-Kuomintang. In 1933 Lu met Edgar Snow. Snow asked Lu if there were any Ah Q's left in China. Lu responded, \"It's worse now. Now it's Ah Q's who are running the country.\"Despite the unfavorable political climate, Lu Xun contributed regularly to a variety of periodicals in the 1930s, including Lin Yutang's humor magazine The Analects Fortnightly, and corresponded with writers in Japan as well as China.Although he had renounced writing fiction years before, in 1934 he published his last collection of short stories, Old Tales Retold. In 1935 he sent a telegram to Communist forces in Shaanxi congratulating them on the recent completion of their Long March. The Communist Party requested that he write a novel about the communist revolution set in rural China, but he declined, citing his lack of background and understanding of the subject.\nLu sent a telegram congratulating the CCP on their completion of the Long March in February 1936. He was a heavy smoker, which may have contributed to the deterioration of his health throughout the year. By 1936 he had developed chronic tuberculosis, and in March of that year he was stricken with bronchitic asthma and a fever. The treatment for this involved draining 300\u00a0grams of fluid in the lungs through a puncture. From June to August, he was again sick, and his weight dropped to only 83 pounds. He recovered somewhat, and wrote two essays in the fall reflecting on mortality. These included \"Death\", and \"This Too Is Life\". A month before his death, he wrote: \"Hold the funeral quickly... do not stage any memorial services. Forget about me, and care about your own life \u2013 you're a fool if you don't.\" Regarding his son, he wrote: \"On no account let him become a good-for-nothing writer or artist.\"\nDeath\nAt 3:30 am on the morning of 18 October, the author woke with great difficulty breathing. Dr. Sudo, his physician, was summoned, and Lu Xun took injections to relieve the pain. His wife was with him throughout that night, but Lu Xun was found without a pulse at 5:11 am the next morning, 19 October. Lu's remains were interred in a mausoleum within Lu Xun Park in Shanghai. Mao Zedong later made the calligraphic inscription above his tomb. He was survived by his son, Zhou Haiying. He was posthumously made a member of the Communist Party for his contributions to the May Fourth Movement.\n\nLegacy\nShortly after Lu Xun's death, Mao Zedong called him \"the saint of modern China,\" but used his legacy selectively to promote his own political goals. In 1942, he quoted Lu out of context to tell his audience to be \"a willing ox\" like Lu Xun was, but told writers and artists who believed in freedom of expression that, because Communist areas were already liberated, they did not need to be like Lu Xun. After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, Communist Party literary theorists portrayed his work as orthodox examples of communist literature, yet every one of Lu's close disciples from the 1930s was purged. Mao admitted that, had Lu survived until the 1950s, he would \"either have gone silent or gone to prison\".\nParty leaders depicted him as \"drawing the blueprint of the communist future\" and Mao Zedong defined him as the \"chief commander of China's Cultural Revolution,\" although Lu did not join the party. During the 1920s and 1930s Lu Xun and his contemporaries often met informally for freewheeling intellectual discussions, but after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 the Party sought more control over intellectual life in China, and this type of intellectual independence was suppressed, often violently. Finally, Lu Xun's satirical and ironic writing style itself was discouraged, ridiculed, then as often as possible destroyed. In 1942, Mao wrote that \"the style of the essay should not simply be like Lu Xun's. [In a Communist society] we can shout at the top of our voices and have no need for veiled and round-about expressions, which are hard for the people to understand. During the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party both hailed Lu Xun as one of the fathers of communism in China, yet ironically suppressed the very intellectual culture and style of writing that he represented. Some of his essays and writings are now part of the primary school and middle school compulsory curriculum in China. Living under the rule of the dark forces and deprived of freedom of speech, Lu Hsun used burning satire and freezing irony, cast in the form of essays, to do battle; and he was entirely right. We, too, must hold up to sharp ridicule the fascists, the Chinese reactionaries and everything that harms the people; but in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the anti-Japanese base areas behind the enemy lines, where democracy and freedom are granted in full to the revolutionary writers and artists and withheld only from the counter-revolutionaries, the style of the essay should not simply be like Lu Hsun's. Here we can shout at the top of our voices and have no need for veiled and roundabout expressions, which are hard for the people to understand.\" In 2007 some of his bleaker works were removed from school textbooks. Julia Lovell, who has translated Lu Xun's writing, speculated that \"perhaps also it was an attempt to discourage the youth of today from Lu Xun's inconveniently fault-finding habits.\"Lu completed volumes of translations, notably from Russian. He particularly admired Nikolai Gogol and made a translation of Dead Souls. His own first story's title, \"Diary of a Madman\", was inspired by a work of Gogol of the same name. As a left-wing writer, Lu played an important role in the development of modern Chinese literature. His books were and remain highly influential and popular today, both in China and internationally. Lu Xun's works appear in high school textbooks in both China and Japan. He is known to Japanese by the name Rojin (\u30ed\u30b8\u30f3 in Katakana or \u9b6f\u8fc5 in Kanji).\nBecause of his leftist political involvement and of the role his works played in the subsequent history of the People's Republic of China, Lu Xun's works were banned in Taiwan until the late 1980s. He was among the early supporters of the Esperanto movement in China.\nLu Xun has been described by Nobel laureate Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce as \"The greatest writer Asia produced in the twentieth century.\" Lu Xun's importance to modern Chinese literature lies in the fact that he contributed significantly to nearly every modern literary medium during his lifetime. He wrote in a clear lucid style which was to influence many generations, in stories, prose poems and essays. Lu Xun's two short story collections, Nahan (Call to Arms) and Panghuang (Wandering), are often acclaimed as classics of modern Chinese literature. Lu Xun's translations were important in a time when Western literature was seldom read, and his literary criticisms remain acute and persuasively argued.\nThe work of Lu Xun has also received attention outside of China. In 1986, Fredric Jameson cited \"A Madman's Diary\" as the \"supreme example\" of the \"national allegory\" form that all Third World literature takes. Gloria Davies compares Lu Xun to Nietzsche, saying that both were \"trapped in the construction of a modernity which is fundamentally problematic\". According to Leonardo Vittorio Arena, Lu Xun cultivates an ambiguous standpoint towards Nietzsche, a mixture of attraction and repulsion, the latter because of Nietzsche's excesses in style and content.\nA major literature prize in China, the Lu Xun Literary Prize is named after him.\nAsteroid (233547) 2007 JR27 was named after him.\nA crater on Mercury is named after him.\nThe artist Shi Lu adopted the second half of his pen name due to his admiration for Lu Xun.Style and thought\nLu Xun was a versatile writer. He wrote using both traditional Chinese conventions and 19th century European literary forms. His style has been described in equally broad terms, conveying both \"sympathetic engagement\" and \"ironic detachment\" at different moments. His essays are often very incisive in his societal commentary, and in his stories his mastery of the vernacular language and tone make some of his literary works (like \"The True Story of Ah Q\") hard to convey through translation. In them, he frequently treads a fine line between criticizing the follies of his characters and sympathizing with those very follies. Lu Xun was a master of irony and satire (as can be seen in \"The True Story of Ah Q\") and yet can write impressively direct with simple engagement (\"My Old Home\", \"A Little Incident\").\n\nLu Xun is typically regarded by Mao Zedong as the most influential Chinese writer who was associated with the May Fourth Movement. He produced harsh criticism of social problems in China, particularly in his analysis of the \"Chinese national character\". He was sometimes called a \"champion of common humanity.\"Lu Xun felt that the 1911 Xinhai Revolution had been a failure. In 1925 he opined, \"I feel the so-called Republic of China has ceased to exist. I feel that, before the revolution, I was a slave, but shortly after the revolution, I have been cheated by slaves and have become their slave.\" He even recommended that his readers heed the critique of Chinese culture in Chinese Characteristics by the missionary writer Arthur Smith. His disillusionment with politics led him to conclude in 1927 that \"revolutionary literature\" alone could not bring about radical change. Rather, \"revolutionary men\" needed to lead a revolution using force.  In the end, he experienced profound disappointment with the new Nationalist government, which he viewed as ineffective and even harmful to China.\n\nBibliography\nShort stories\nNostalgia (1909)\u300a\u5450\u558a\u300b (1923), translated as Call to Arms (Yang and Yang), Cheering from the Sidelines (Lyell) and Outcry (Lovell):\n\nA Madman's Diary (1918)\nKong Yiji (1918)\nMedicine (1919)\nTomorrow (1920)\nAn Incident (1920)\nThe Story of Hair (1920)\nA Storm in a Teacup (1920)\nHometown (1921)\nThe True Story of Ah Q (1921)\nThe Double Fifth Festival (1922)\nThe White Light (1922)\nThe Rabbits and the Cat (1922)\nThe Comedy of the Ducks (1922)\nVillage Opera (1922)\u300a\u5f77\u5fa8\u300b (1926), translated as Wandering (Yang and Yang), Wondering Where to Turn (Lyell) and Hesitation (Lovell):\n\nNew Year Sacrifice (1924)\nIn the Drinking House (1924)\nA Happy Family (1924)\nSoap (1924)\nThe Eternal Flame (1924)\nPublic Exhibition (1925)\nOld Mr. Gao (1925)\nThe Misanthrope (1925)\nSadness\nBrothers\nDivorce (1925)\u300a\u6545\u4e8b\u65b0\u7f16\u300b (1935), translated as Old Tales Retold (Yang and Yang) and Old Stories Retold (Lovell):\n\nMending Heaven (1935)\nThe Flight to the Moon (1926)\nCurbing the Flood (1935)\nGathering Vetch (1935)\nForging the Swords (1926)\nLeaving the Pass (1935)\nOpposing Aggression (1934)\nResurrect the Dead (1935)Essays\n\"My Views on Chastity\" (1918)\n\"What Is Required to Be a Father Today\" (1919)\n\"Knowledge Is a Crime\" (1919)\n\"What Happens After Nora Walks Out?\" Based on a talk given at the Beijing Women's Normal College, 26 December 1923.

However, there was not a complete translation of the fiction until the four-volume set of his writings, which included Selected Stories of Lu Hsun translated by Yang Hsien-yi and Gladys Yang. Another full selection was William A. Lyell. Diary of a Madman and Other Stories. (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press,  1990). In 2009, Penguin Classics published a complete translation by Julia Lovell of his fiction, The Real Story of Ah-Q and Other Tales of China: The Complete Fiction of Lu Xun, which the scholar Jeffrey Wasserstrom said \"could be considered the most significant Penguin Classic ever published.\"The Lyrical Lu Xun: a Study of his Classical-style Verse\u2014a book by Jon Eugene von Kowallis (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1996) \u2013 includes a complete introduction to Lu Xun's poetry in the classical style, with Chinese characters, literal and verse translations, and a biographical introduction which summarizes his life in relation to his poetry.\nCapturing Chinese: Short Stories from Lu Xun's Nahan, edited by Kevin Nadolny, includes short summaries to Lu Xun's stories, the Chinese text in simplified characters, pinyin, and definitions for difficult vocabulary.In 2017, Harvard University Press published a book of his essays titled Jottings under Lamplight.\n\nSee also\nZhou Jianren (brother)\nZhou Zuoren (brother)\nLu Xun Literary Institute\nLu Xun Literary Prize\nLu Xun Native PlaceReferences\nCitations\nSources\nArena, Leonardo Vittorio.

His father, Alfred Alexander Young, was a physician. His mother, Mary Clark Starks, was a direct descendant of the McGehees, an old planter family; she died when he was nine years old.  Shortly after her death, Young was sent to live at the McGehee Plantation in Senatobia, Mississippi.Young entered the University of Mississippi at the age of 15 and graduated from that institution in 1901.  He completed his Master's Degree at Columbia University in New York in 1902.\n\nCareer\nYoung taught at the University of Mississippi in 1905-1907, and then moved to the University of Texas at Austin.  There he established the Texas Review and became involved with theater. In 1915 he moved to Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he taught English until 1921.\nHe resigned to pursue other interests and moved to New York City. In New York, he was appointed as an editor of Theatre Arts Magazine and as drama critic for The New Republic.  Young worked at The New Republic until his retirement in 1947. During this period he was also professionally involved with the theater in New York and wrote several plays. Young's plays include: Guenevere, Addio, Madretta, At The Shrine, The Star In The Trees, Twilight Saint, The Dead Poet, The Seven Kings and the Wind, and The Queen of Sheba, to name a few.\nIn 1926 Stark Young wrote his first novel Heaven Trees. In 1930, Young contributed to the agrarian manifesto, I'll Take My Stand. He was one of 12 Southern writers, a group including Allen Tate, known as the Southern Agrarians. Young drew on the traditions of his Southern upbringing for inspiration.  He wrote essays, journalistic articles, and collections of stories that drew on these sources.  He also published four novels dealing with Southern themes.\nSo Red the Rose (1934), perhaps Young's finest novel, had a brief period of popularity as the archetype of the Southern Civil War novel and dealt with the aftermath of the war. In 1935, his novel was adapted as a film of the same name directed by King Vidor and starring Margaret Sullavan.  Described by its author as a novel of the affections, the book is still in print. The phenomenal successes of Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind (1936) and its film adaptation of 1939 pushed Young's book into the background.\nYoung translated a number of plays by Anton Chekhov, including The Sea Gull, Uncle Vanya, The Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard, all of which were published in 1956 by The Modern Library as Best Plays by Chekhov.\nIn the 1940s Young, a self-taught artist, began painting. He had two one-man exhibitions in New York. His paintings were shown in four important venues, including the Art Institute of Chicago, which purchased one of his works for its permanent collection.\nIn 1951 Young published his memoir, The Pavilion, dedicated to his friend Allen Tate.\nYoung was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame, as well as the New York University Hall of Fame. He was the recipient of Creative Arts Medallion from Brandeis University and the Southeastern Theatre Conference's Distinguished Career Award. Additionally, he received the Order of the Crown of Italy for a series of lectures on American theater. He gave them in Italian as a Westinghouse Lecturer in Italy. He served on the board of New York University and was a theater critic for the New York Times.\n\nDeath\nYoung suffered a stroke in May 1959 and died four years later. He was buried in Friendship Cemetery in Como, Mississippi.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nWorks by or about Stark Young at Internet Archive\nFinding aid to Stark Young manuscripts at Columbia University.

At the height of his literary career, in the 1920s and 1930s, he was one of the most widely translated and most popular writers in the world.Zweig was raised in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. He wrote historical studies of famous literary figures, such as Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Charles Dickens, and Fyodor Dostoevsky in Drei Meister (1920; Three Masters), and decisive historical events in Sternstunden der Menschheit (1928; published in English in 1940 as The Tide of Fortune: Twelve Historical Miniatures). He wrote biographies of Joseph Fouch\u00e9 (1929), Mary Stuart (1935) and Marie Antoinette (Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman, 1932), among others. Zweig's best-known fiction includes Letter from an Unknown Woman (1922), Amok (1922), Fear (1925), Confusion of Feelings (1927), Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman (1927), the psychological novel Ungeduld des Herzens (Beware of Pity, 1939), and The Royal Game (1941).\nIn 1934, as a result of the Nazi Party's rise in Germany, Zweig emigrated to England and then, in 1940, moved briefly to New York and then to Brazil, where he settled. In his final years, he would declare himself in love with the country, writing about it in the book Brazil, Land of the Future. Nonetheless, as the years passed Zweig became increasingly disillusioned and despairing at the future of Europe, and he and his wife Lotte were found dead of a barbiturate overdose in their house in Petr\u00f3polis on 23 February 1942; they had died the previous day. His work has been the basis for several film adaptations. Zweig's memoir, Die Welt von Gestern (The World of Yesterday, 1942), is noted for its description of life during the waning years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire under Franz Joseph I and has been called the most famous book on the Habsburg Empire.\nBiography\nZweig was born in Vienna, the son of Moritz Zweig (1845\u20131926), a wealthy Jewish textile manufacturer, and Ida Brettauer (1854\u20131938), a daughter of a Jewish banking family. He was related to the Czech writer Egon Hostovsk\u00fd, who described him as \"a very distant relative\"; some sources describe them as cousins.Zweig studied philosophy at the University of Vienna and in 1904 earned a doctoral degree with a thesis on \"The Philosophy of Hippolyte Taine\". Religion did not play a central role in his education. \"My mother and father were Jewish only through accident of birth\", Zweig said later in an interview. Yet he did not renounce his Jewish faith and wrote repeatedly on Jews and Jewish themes, as in his story Buchmendel. Zweig had a warm relationship with Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, whom he met when Herzl was still literary editor of the Neue Freie Presse, then Vienna's main newspaper; Herzl accepted for publication some of Zweig's early essays. Zweig, a committed cosmopolitan, believed in internationalism and in Europeanism, as The World of Yesterday, his autobiography, makes clear: \"I was sure in my heart from the first of my identity as a citizen of the world.\" According to Amos Elon, Zweig called Herzl's book Der Judenstaat an \"obtuse text, [a] piece of nonsense\".Zweig served in the Archives of the Ministry of War and adopted a pacifist stance like his friend Romain Rolland, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature 1915. Zweig married Friderike Maria von Winternitz (born Burger) in 1920; they divorced in 1938. As Friderike Zweig she published a book on her former husband after his death. She later also published a picture book on Zweig. In the late summer of 1939, Zweig married his secretary Elisabet Charlotte \"Lotte\" Altmann in Bath, England. Zweig's secretary in Salzburg from November 1919 to March 1938 was Anna Meingast (13 May 1881, Vienna \u2013 17 November 1953, Salzburg).\nAs a Jew, Zweig's high profile did not shield him from the threat of persecution. In 1934, following Hitler's rise to power in Germany, Zweig left Austria for England, living first in London, then from 1939 in Bath. Because of the swift advance of Hitler's troops westwards, and the threat of arrest or worse \u2013 as part of the preparations for Operation Seel\u00f6we a list of persons to be detained immediately after conquest of the British Isles, the so-called Black Book, had been assembled and Zweig was on page 231, with his London address fully mentioned \u2013 Zweig and his second wife crossed the Atlantic to the United States, settling in 1940 in New York City; they lived for two months as guests of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, then they rented a house in Ossining, New York.\nOn 22 August 1940, they moved again to Petr\u00f3polis, a German-colonized mountain town 68 kilometres north of Rio de Janeiro. Zweig, feeling increasingly depressed about the situation in Europe and the future for humanity, wrote in a letter to author Jules Romains, \"My inner crisis consists in that I am not able to identify myself with the me of passport, the self of exile\". On 23 February 1942, the Zweigs were found dead of a barbiturate overdose in their house in the city of Petr\u00f3polis, holding hands. He had been despairing at the future of Europe and its culture. \"I think it better to conclude in good time and in erect bearing a life in which intellectual labour meant the purest joy and personal freedom the highest good on Earth\", he wrote.The Zweigs' house in Brazil was later turned into a cultural centre and is now known as Casa Stefan Zweig.\n\nWork\nZweig was a prominent writer in the 1920s and 1930s, befriending Arthur Schnitzler and Sigmund Freud. He was extremely popular in the United States, South America and Europe, and remains so in continental Europe; however, he was largely ignored by the British public. His fame in America had diminished until the 1990s, when there began an effort on the part of several publishers (notably Pushkin Press, Hesperus Press, and The New York Review of Books) to get Zweig back into print in English. Plunkett Lake Press has reissued electronic versions of his non-fiction works. Since that time there has been a marked resurgence and a number of Zweig's books are back in print.Critical opinion of his oeuvre is strongly divided between those who praise his humanism, simplicity and effective style, and those who criticize his literary style as poor, lightweight and superficial. Michael Hofmann scathingly attacks Zweig's work. Hofmann uses the term \"vermicular dither\u201d to refer to a passage attributed to Zweig and quoted in 1972, though the passage does not occur in Zweig's published work. Hofmann adds that in his opinion \"Zweig just tastes fake. He's the Pepsi of Austrian writing.\" Even the author's suicide note, Hofmann suggests, causes one to feel \"the irritable rise of boredom halfway through it, and the sense that he doesn't mean it, his heart isn't in it (not even in his suicide)\".Zweig is best known for his novellas (notably The Royal Game, Amok, and Letter from an Unknown Woman \u2013 which was filmed in 1948 by Max Oph\u00fcls), novels (Beware of Pity, Confusion of Feelings, and the posthumously published The Post Office Girl) and biographies (notably of Erasmus of Rotterdam, Ferdinand Magellan, and Mary, Queen of Scots, and also the posthumously published one on Balzac). At one time his works were published without his consent in English under the pseudonym \"Stephen Branch\" (a translation of his real name) when anti-German sentiment was running high. His 1932 biography of Queen Marie Antoinette was adapted by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a 1938 film starring Norma Shearer.\nZweig's memoir, The World of Yesterday, was completed in 1942 one day before he committed suicide. It has been widely discussed as a record of \"what it meant to be alive between 1881 and 1942\" in central Europe; the book has attracted both critical praise and hostile dismissal.\nZweig acknowledged his debt to psychoanalysis. In a letter dated 8 September 1926, he wrote to Freud, \"Psychology is the great business of my life\". He went on explaining that Freud had considerable influence on a number of writers such as Marcel Proust, D.H. Lawrence and James Joyce giving them a lesson in \"courage\" and helping them overcome their inhibitions. \"Thanks to you, we see many things. \u2013 Thanks to you we say many things which otherwise we would not have seen nor said.\" Autobiography, in particular, had become \"more clear-sighted and audacious\".Zweig enjoyed a close association with Richard Strauss, and provided the libretto for Die schweigsame Frau (The Silent Woman). Strauss famously defied the Nazi regime by refusing to sanction the removal of Zweig's name from the programme  for the work's premi\u00e8re on 24 June 1935 in Dresden. As a result, Goebbels refused to attend as planned, and the opera was banned after three performances. Zweig later collaborated with Joseph Gregor, to provide Strauss with the libretto for one other opera, Daphne, in 1937. At least one other work by Zweig received a musical setting: the pianist and composer Henry Jolles, who like Zweig had fled to Brazil to escape the Nazis, composed a song, \"\u00daltimo poema de Stefan Zweig\", based on \"Letztes Gedicht\", which Zweig wrote on the occasion of his 60th birthday in November 1941. During his stay in Brazil, Zweig wrote Brasilien, Ein Land der Zukunft (Brazil, A Land of the Future) which consisted in a collection of essays on the history and culture of his newly adopted country.\nZweig was a passionate collector of manuscripts. There are important Zweig collections at the British Library, at the State University of New York at Fredonia and at the National Library of Israel. The British Library's Stefan Zweig Collection was donated to the library by his heirs in May 1986. It specialises in autograph music manuscripts, including works by Bach, Haydn, Wagner, and Mahler. It has been described as \"one of the world's greatest collections of autograph manuscripts\". One particularly precious item is Mozart's \"Verzeichn\u00fc\u00df aller meiner Werke\" \u2013 that is, the composer's own handwritten thematic catalogue of his works.\nThe 1993\u20131994 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.\n\nBibliography\nThe dates mentioned below are the dates of first publication in German.\n\nFiction\nForgotten Dreams, 1900 (Original title: Vergessene Tr\u00e4ume)\nSpring in the Prater, 1900 (Original title: Praterfr\u00fchling)\nA Loser, 1901 (Original title: Ein Verbummelter)\nIn the Snow, 1901 (Original title: Im Schnee)\nTwo Lonely Souls, 1901 (Original title: Zwei Einsame)\nThe Miracles of Life, 1903 (Original title: Die Wunder des Lebens)\nThe Love of Erika Ewald, 1904 (Original title: Die Liebe der Erika Ewald)\nThe Star Over the Forest, 1904 (Original title: Der Stern \u00fcber dem Walde)\nThe Fowler Snared, 1906 (Original title: Sommernovellette)\nThe Governess, 1907 (Original title: Die Governante)\nScarlet Fever, 1908 (Original title: Scharlach)\nTwilight, 1910 (Original title: Geschichte eines Unterganges)\n\"A Story Told In Twilight\", 1911, short story (Original title: Geschichte in der D\u00e4mmerung)\nBurning Secret, 1913 (Original title: Brennendes Geheimnis)\nFear, 1920 (Original title: Angst)\nCompulsion, 1920 (Original title: Der Zwang)\nFantastic Night, 1922 (Original title: Phantastische Nacht)\nLetter from an Unknown Woman, 1922 (Original title: Brief einer Unbekannten)\nMoonbeam Alley, 1922 (Original title: Die Mondscheingasse)\nAmok, 1922 (Original title: Amok) \u2013 novella, initially published with several others in Amok.

Anderson said that he had \"stolen\" from Zweig's novels Beware of Pity and The Post-Office Girl in writing the film, and it features actors Tom Wilkinson as The Author, a character based loosely on Zweig, and Jude Law as his younger, idealised self seen in flashbacks. Anderson also said that the film's protagonist, the concierge Gustave H., played by Ralph Fiennes, was based on Zweig. In the film's opening sequence, a teenage girl visits a shrine for The Author, which includes a bust of him wearing Zweig-like spectacles and celebrated as his country's \"National Treasure\".The 2017 Austrian-German-French film Vor der Morgenr\u00f6te (Stefan Zweig: Farewell to Europe) chronicles Stefan Zweig's travels in the North and South Americas, trying to come to terms with his exile from home.\nThe 2018 American short film Crep\u00fasculo by Clemy Clarke is based on Zweig's short story \"A Story Told in Twilight\" and relocated to a quincea\u00f1era in 1980s New York.TV film La Ruelle au clair de lune (1988) by \u00c9douard Molinaro is an adaptation of Zweig's short-story Moonbeam Alley.\nSee also\nLe Monde's 100 Books of the Century, a list which includes Confusion of FeelingsReferences\nFurther reading\nElizabeth Allday, Stefan Zweig: A Critical Biography, J.

He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art and edited BLAST, the literary magazine of the Vorticists.His novels include Tarr (1918) and The Human Age trilogy, composed of The Childermass (1928), Monstre Gai (1955) and Malign Fiesta (1955). A fourth volume, titled The Trial of Man, was unfinished at the time of his death. He also wrote two autobiographical volumes: Blasting and Bombardiering (1937) and Rude Assignment: A Narrative of my Career Up-to-Date (1950).\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nLewis was born on 18 November 1882, reputedly on his father's yacht off the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. His English mother, Anne Stuart Lewis (n\u00e9e Prickett), and American father, Charles Edward Lewis, separated about 1893. His mother subsequently returned to England. Lewis was educated in England at Rugby School and then Slade School of Fine Art, University College London. He spent most of the 1900s travelling around Europe and studying art in Paris. While in Paris, he attended lectures by Henri Bergson on process philosophy.\n\nEarly work and development of Vorticism (1908\u20131915)\nIn 1908, Lewis moved to London, where he would reside for much of his life. In 1909, he published his first work, accounts of his travels in Brittany, in Ford Madox Ford's The English Review. He was a founding member of the Camden Town Group, which brought him into close contact with the Bloomsbury Group, particularly Roger Fry and Clive Bell, with whom he soon fell out.\nIn 1912, Lewis exhibited his work at the second Postimpressionist exhibition: Cubo-Futurist illustrations to Timon of Athens and three major oil paintings. In 1912, he was commissioned to produce a decorative mural, a drop curtain, and more designs for The Cave of the Golden Calf, an avant-garde cabaret and nightclub on Heddon Street.From 1913 to 1915, Lewis developed the style of geometric abstraction for which he is best known today, which his friend Ezra Pound dubbed \"Vorticism.\" Lewis sought to combine the strong structure of Cubism, which he found was not \"alive,\" with the liveliness of Futurist art, which lacked structure. The combination was a strikingly dramatic critique of modernity. In his early visual works, Lewis may have been influenced by Bergson's process philosophy. Though he was later savagely critical of Bergson, he admitted in a letter to Theodore Weiss (19 April 1949) that he \"began by embracing his evolutionary system.\" Nietzsche was an equally important influence.\nLewis had a brief tenure at Roger Fry's Omega Workshops, but left after a quarrel with Fry over a commission to provide wall decorations for the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition, which Lewis believed Fry had misappropriated. He and several other Omega artists started a competing workshop called the Rebel Art Centre. The Centre operated for only four months, but it gave birth to the Vorticist group and its publication, BLAST. In BLAST, Lewis formally expounded the Vorticist aesthetic in a manifesto, distinguishing it from other avant-garde practices. He also wrote and published a play, Enemy of the Stars. It is a proto-absurdist, Expressionist drama. Lewis scholar Melania Terrazas identifies it as a precursor to the plays of Samuel Beckett.\nWorld War I (1915\u20131918)\nIn 1915, the Vorticists held their only U.K. exhibition before the movement broke up, largely as a result of World War I. Lewis himself was posted to the western front and served as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. Much of his time was spent in Forward Observation Posts looking down at apparently deserted German lines, registering targets and calling down fire from batteries massed around the rim of the Ypres Salient. He made vivid accounts of narrow misses and deadly artillery duels.After the Third Battle of Ypres, Lewis was appointed as an official war artist for both the Canadian and British governments. For the Canadians, he painted A Canadian Gun-pit (1918) from sketches made on Vimy Ridge. For the British, he painted one of his best-known works, A Battery Shelled (1919), drawing on his own experience at Ypres. Lewis exhibited his war drawings and some other paintings of the war in an exhibition, \"Guns\", in 1918.\nAlthough the Vorticist group broke up after the war, Lewis's patron, John Quinn, organized a Vorticist exhibition at the Penguin Club in New York in 1917. His first novel, Tarr, was serialized in The Egoist during 1916\u201317 and published in book form in 1918. It is widely regarded as one of the key modernist texts.Lewis later documented his experiences and opinions of this period of his life in the autobiographical Blasting and Bombardiering (1937), which covered his life up to 1926.\n\nTyros and writing (1918\u20131929)\nAfter the war, Lewis resumed his career as a painter with a major exhibition, Tyros and Portraits, at the Leicester Galleries in 1921. \"Tyros\" were satirical caricatures intended to comment on the culture of the \"new epoch\" that succeeded the First World War. A Reading of Ovid and Mr Wyndham Lewis as a Tyro are the only surviving oil paintings from this series. Lewis also launched his second magazine, The Tyro, of which there were only two issues. The second (1922) contained an important statement of Lewis's visual aesthetic: \"Essay on the Objective of Plastic Art in our Time\". It was during the early 1920s that he perfected his incisive draughtsmanship.\nBy the late 1920s, he concentrated on writing. He launched yet another magazine, The Enemy (1927\u20131929), largely written by himself and declaring its belligerent critical stance in its title. The magazine and other theoretical and critical works he published from 1926 to 1929 mark a deliberate separation from the avant-garde and his previous associates. He believed that their work failed to show sufficient critical awareness of those ideologies that worked against truly revolutionary change in the West, and therefore became a vehicle for these pernicious ideologies. His major theoretical and cultural statement from this period is The Art of Being Ruled (1926).\nTime and Western Man (1927) is a cultural and philosophical discussion that includes penetrating critiques of James Joyce, Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound that are still read. Lewis also attacked the process philosophy of Bergson, Samuel Alexander, Alfred North Whitehead, and others.\nFiction and political writing (1930\u20131936)\nIn 1930 Lewis published The Apes of God, a biting satirical attack on the London literary scene, including a long chapter caricaturing the Sitwell family, which may have harmed his position in the literary world. In 1937 he published The Revenge for Love, set in the period leading up to the Spanish Civil War and regarded by many as his best novel. It is strongly critical of communist activity in Spain and presents English intellectual fellow travellers as deluded.\nDespite serious illness necessitating several operations, he was very productive as a critic and painter. He produced a book of poems, One-Way Song, in 1933, and a revised version of Enemy of the Stars. An important book of critical essays also belongs to this period: Men without Art (1934). It grew out of a defence of Lewis's satirical practice in The Apes of God and puts forward a theory of 'non-moral', or metaphysical, satire. The book is probably best remembered for one of the first commentaries on Faulkner and a famous essay on Hemingway.\n\nReturn to painting (1936\u20131941)\nAfter becoming better known for his writing than his painting in the 1920s and early 1930s, he returned to more concentrated work on visual art, and paintings from the 1930s and 1940s constitute some of his best-known work. The Surrender of Barcelona (1936\u201337) makes a significant statement about the Spanish Civil War. It was included in an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in 1937 that Lewis hoped would re-establish his reputation as a painter. After the publication in The Times of a letter of support for the exhibition, asking that something from the show be purchased for the national collection (signed by, among others, Stephen Spender, W. H. Auden, Geoffrey Grigson, Rebecca West, Naomi Mitchison, Henry Moore and Eric Gill) the Tate Gallery bought the painting, Red Scene. Like others from the exhibition, it shows an influence from Surrealism and de Chirico's Metaphysical Painting. Lewis was highly critical of the ideology of Surrealism, but admired the visual qualities of some Surrealist art.\nDuring this period, Lewis also produced many of his most well-known portraits, including pictures of Edith Sitwell (1923\u20131936), T. S. Eliot (1938 and 1949), and Ezra Pound (1939). His 1938 portrait of Eliot was rejected by the selection committee of the Royal Academy for their annual exhibition and caused a furore, when Augustus John resigned in protest.\n\nWorld War II and North America (1941\u20131945)\nLewis spent World War II in the United States and Canada. In 1941, in Toronto, he produced a series of watercolor fantasies centered on themes of creation, crucifixion and bathing.\nHe grew to appreciate the cosmopolitan and \"rootless\" nature of the American melting pot, declaring that the greatest advantage of being American was to have \"turned one's back on race, caste, and all that pertains to the rooted state.\" He praised the contributions of African-Americans to American culture, and regarded Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco as the \"best North American artists,\" predicting that when \"the Indian culture of Mexico melts into the great American mass to the North, the Indian will probably give it its art.\" He returned to England in 1945.\n\nLater life and blindness (1945\u20131951)\nBy 1951, he was completely blinded by a pituitary tumor that placed pressure on his optic nerve. It ended his artistic career, but he continued writing until his death. He published several autobiographical and critical works: Rude Assignment (1950), Rotting Hill (1951), a collection of allegorical short stories about his life in \"the capital of a dying empire\"; The Writer and the Absolute (1952), a book of essays on writers including George Orwell, Jean-Paul Sartre and Andr\u00e9 Malraux; and the semi-autobiographical novel Self Condemned (1954).\nThe BBC commissioned Lewis to complete his 1928 work The Childermass, which was published as The Human Age and dramatized for the BBC Third Programme in 1955. In 1956, the Tate Gallery held a major exhibition of his work, \"Wyndham Lewis and Vorticism\", in the catalogue to which he declared that \"Vorticism, in fact, was what I, personally, did and said at a certain period\"\u2014a statement which brought forth a series of \"Vortex Pamphlets\" from his fellow \"BLAST\" signatory William Roberts.\n\nPersonal life\nFrom 1918 to 1921, Lewis lived with Iris Barry, with whom he had two children. He is said to have shown little affection for them.In 1930, Lewis married Gladys Anne Hoskins (1900\u20131979), eighteen years his junior and affectionately known as Froanna. They lived together for ten years before marrying and never had children.Lewis kept Froanna in the background, and many of his friends were simply unaware of her existence. It seems that Lewis was extraordinarily jealous and protective of his wife, owing to her youth and beauty. Froanna was patient and caring toward her husband through financial troubles and his frequent illnesses. She was the model for some of Lewis's most tender and intimate portraits, as well as a number of characters in his fiction. In contrast to his earlier, impersonal portraits, which are purely concerned with external appearance, the portraits of Froanna show a preoccupation with her inner life.Always interested in Roman Catholicism, he never converted. He died in 1957. By the time of his death, Lewis had written 40 books in all.\n\nPolitical views\nIn 1931, after a visit to Berlin, Lewis published Hitler (1931), a book presenting Adolf Hitler as a \"man of peace\" whose party-members were threatened by communist street violence. His unpopularity among liberals and anti-fascists grew, especially after Hitler came to power in 1933. Following a second visit to Germany in 1937, Lewis changed his views and began to retract his previous political comments. he recognized the reality of Nazi treatment of Jews after a visit to Berlin in 1937. In 1939, he published an attack on anti-semitism, The Jews, Are They Human?, which was favorably reviewed in The Jewish Chronicle. He also published The Hitler Cult (1939), which firmly revoked his earlier support for Hitler.Politically, Lewis remained an isolated figure through the 1930s. In Letter to Lord Byron, W. H. Auden called Lewis \"that lonely old volcano of the Right.\" Lewis thought there was what he called a \"left-wing orthodoxy\" in Britain in the 1930s. He believed it was against Britain's self-interest to ally  with the Soviet Union, \"which the newspapers most of us read tell us has slaughtered out-of-hand, only a few years ago, millions of its better fed citizens, as well as its whole imperial family.\"\nIn Anglosaxony: A League that Works (1941), Lewis reflected on his earlier support for fascism:Fascism \u2013 once I understood it \u2013 left me colder than communism. The latter at least pretended, at the start, to have something to do with helping the helpless and making the world a more decent and sensible place. It does start from the human being and his suffering. Whereas fascism glorifies bloodshed and preaches that man should model himself upon the wolf.His sense that America and Canada lacked a British-type class structure had increased his opinion of liberal democracy, and in the same pamphlet, Lewis defends liberal democracy's respect for individual freedom against its critics on both the left and right. In America and Cosmic Man (1949), Lewis argued that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had successfully managed to reconcile individual rights with the demands of the state.Legacy\nIn recent years, there has been renewed critical and biographical interest in Lewis and his work, and he is now regarded as a major British artist and writer of the twentieth century. Rugby School hosted an exhibition of his works in November 2007 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his death. The National Portrait Gallery in London held a major retrospective of his portraits in 2008. Two years later, held at the Fundaci\u00f3n Juan March (Madrid, Spain), a large exhibition (Wyndham Lewis 1882\u20131957) featured a comprehensive collection of Lewis's paintings and drawings. As Tom Lubbock pointed out, it was \"the retrospective that Britain has never managed to get together.\".In 2010, Oxford World Classics published a critical edition of the 1928 text of \"Tarr\", edited by Scott W. Klein of Wake Forest University. The Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University held an exhibition entitled \"The Vorticists: Rebel Artists in London and New York, 1914\u201318\" from 30 September 2010 through 2 January 2011. The exhibition then travelled to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice (29 January \u2013 15 May 2011: \"I Vorticisti: Artisti ribellia a Londra e New York, 1914\u20131918\") and then to Tate Britain under the title \"The Vorticists: Manifesto for a Modern World\" between 14 June and 4 September 2011.\nSeveral readings by Lewis are collected on The Enemy Speaks, an audiobook CD published in 2007 and featuring extracts from \"One Way Song\" and \"The Apes of God\", as well as radio talks titled \"When John Bull Laughs\" (1938), \"A Crisis of Thought\" (1947) and \"The Essential Purposes of Art\" (1951).\nA blue plaque now stands on the house in Kensington, London, where Lewis lived, No. 61 Palace Gardens Terrace.\nCritical reception\nWalter Sickert once claimed that, \"Wyndham Lewis [is] the greatest portraitist of this or any other time.\"In his essay \"Good Bad Books\", George Orwell presents Lewis as the exemplary writer who is cerebral without being artistic. Orwell wrote, \"Enough talent to set up dozens of ordinary writers has been poured into Wyndham Lewis's so-called novels... Yet it would be a very heavy labour to read one of these books right through. Some indefinable quality, a sort of literary vitamin, which exists even in a book like [1922 melodrama] If Winter Comes, is absent from them.\"\nAnti-semitism\nFor many years, Lewis's novels have been criticised for their satirical and hostile portrayals of Jews. Tarr was revised and republished in 1928, giving a new Jewish character a key role in making sure a duel is fought. This has been interpreted as an allegorical representation of a supposed Zionist conspiracy against the West. His literary satire The Apes of God has been interpreted similarly, because many of the characters are Jewish, including the modernist author and editor Julius Ratner, a portrait which blends anti-semitic stereotype with historical literary figures John Rodker and James Joyce.\nA key feature of these interpretations is that Lewis is held to have kept his conspiracy theories hidden and marginalized. Since the publication of Anthony Julius's T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form (1995), where Lewis's anti-semitism is described as \"essentially trivial\", this view is no longer taken seriously.\nBooks\nTarr (1918) (novel)\nThe Caliph's Design\u00a0: Architects!

Her mother was Julia Prinsep Jackson and her father Leslie Stephen. While the boys in the family received college educations, the girls were home-schooled in English classics and Victorian literature. An important influence in Virginia Woolf's early life was the summer home the family used in St Ives, Cornwall, where she first saw the Godrevy Lighthouse, which was to become central to her novel To the Lighthouse (1927).\nWoolf's childhood came to an abrupt end in 1895 with the death of her mother and her first mental breakdown, followed two years later by the death of her half-sister and a mother figure to her, Stella Duckworth. From 1897 to 1901, she attended the Ladies' Department of King's College London, where she studied classics and history and came into contact with early reformers of women's higher education and the women's rights movement. Other important influences were her Cambridge-educated brothers and unfettered access to her father's vast library.\nEncouraged by her father, Woolf began writing professionally in 1900. Her father's death in 1904 caused Woolf to have another mental breakdown. Following his death, the Stephen family moved from Kensington to the more bohemian Bloomsbury, where they adopted a free-spirited lifestyle. It was in Bloomsbury where, in conjunction with the brothers' intellectual friends, they formed the artistic and literary Bloomsbury Group.\nIn 1912, she married Leonard Woolf, and in 1917 the couple founded the Hogarth Press, which published much of her work. They rented a home in Sussex and moved there permanently in 1940. Throughout her life, Woolf was troubled by her mental illness. She was institutionalised several times and attempted suicide at least twice. Her illness may have been bipolar disorder, for which there was no effective intervention during her lifetime. In 1941, at age 59, Woolf died by drowning herself in the River Ouse at Lewes.\nDuring the interwar period, Woolf was an important part of London's literary and artistic society. In 1915 she published her first novel, The Voyage Out, through her half-brother's publishing house, Gerald Duckworth and Company. Her best-known works include the novels Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927), and Orlando (1928). She is also known for her essays, including A Room of One's Own (1929), in which she wrote the much-quoted dictum, \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.\"\nWoolf became one of the central subjects of the 1970s movement of feminist criticism and her works have since garnered much attention and widespread commentary for \"inspiring feminism\". Her works have been translated into more than 50 languages. A large body of literature is dedicated to her life and work, and she has been the subject of plays, novels, and films. Woolf is commemorated today by statues, societies dedicated to her work and a building at the University of London.\n\nLife\nFamily of origin\nVirginia Woolf was born Adeline Virginia Stephen on 25 January 1882 at 22 Hyde Park Gate in South Kensington, London, to Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) and Leslie Stephen (1832\u20131904), writer, historian, essayist, biographer and mountaineer. Julia Jackson was born in 1846 in Calcutta, British India to John Jackson and Maria \"Mia\" Theodosia Pattle, from two Anglo-Indian families. John Jackson FRCS was the third son of George Jackson and Mary Howard of Bengal, a physician who spent 25 years with the Bengal Medical Service and East India Company and a professor at the fledgling Calcutta Medical College. While John Jackson was an almost invisible presence, the Pattle family were famous beauties, and moved in the upper circles of Bengali society. The seven Pattle sisters married into important families. Julia Margaret Cameron was a celebrated photographer, while Virginia married Earl Somers, and their daughter, Julia Jackson's cousin, was Lady Henry Somerset, the temperance leader. Julia moved to England with her mother at the age of two and spent much of her early life with another of her mother's sisters, Sarah Monckton Pattle. Sarah and her husband Henry Thoby Prinsep, conducted an artistic and literary salon at Little Holland House where she came into contact with a number of Pre-Raphaelite painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, for whom she modelled.Julia was the youngest of three sisters, and Adeline Virginia was named after her mother's eldest sister Adeline Maria Jackson (1837\u20131881) and her mother's aunt Virginia Pattle (see Pattle family tree). Because of the tragedy of her aunt Adeline's death the previous year, the family never used Virginia's first name. The Jacksons were a well educated, literary and artistic proconsular middle-class family. In 1867, Julia Jackson married Herbert Duckworth, a barrister, but within three years was left a widow with three infant children. She was devastated and entered a prolonged period of mourning, abandoning her faith and turning to nursing and philanthropy. Julia and Herbert Duckworth had three children:\nGeorge (5 March 1868 \u2013 27 April 1934), a senior civil servant, married Lady Margaret Herbert in 1904\nStella (30 May 1869 \u2013 19 July 1897), died aged 28\nGerald (29 October 1870 \u2013 28 September 1937), founder of Duckworth Publishing, married Cecil Alice Scott-Chad in 1921\nLeslie Stephen was born in 1832 in South Kensington to Sir James and Lady Jane Catherine Stephen (n\u00e9e Venn), daughter of John Venn, rector of Clapham. The Venns were the centre of the evangelical Clapham Sect. Sir James Stephen was the under secretary at the Colonial Office, and with another Clapham member, William Wilberforce, was responsible for the passage of the Slavery Abolition Bill in 1833. In 1849 he was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University. As a family of educators, lawyers and writers the Stephens represented the elite intellectual aristocracy. While his family were distinguished and intellectual, they were less colourful and aristocratic than Julia Jackson's. A graduate and fellow of Cambridge University he renounced his faith and position to move to London where he became a notable man of letters. In addition he was a rambler and mountaineer, described as a \"gaunt figure with the ragged red brown beard...a formidable man, with an immensely high forehead, steely-blue eyes, and a long pointed nose\". In the same year as Julia Jackson's marriage, he wed Harriet Marian (Minny) Thackeray (1840\u20131875), youngest daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray, who bore him a daughter, Laura (1870\u20131945), but died in childbirth in 1875. Laura was developmentally disabled and eventually institutionalised.The widowed Julia Duckworth knew Leslie Stephen through her friendship with Minny's elder sister Anne (Anny) Isabella Ritchie and had developed an interest in his agnostic writings. She was present the night Minny died and later, tended to Leslie Stephen and helped him move next door to her on Hyde Park Gate so Laura could have some companionship with her own children. Both were preoccupied with mourning and although they developed a close friendship and intense correspondence, agreed it would go no further. Leslie Stephen proposed to her in 1877, an offer she declined, but when Anny married later that year she accepted him and they were married on 26 March 1878. He and Laura then moved next door into Julia's house, where they lived till his death in 1904. Julia was 32 and Leslie was 46.Their first child, Vanessa, was born on 30 May 1879. Julia, having presented her husband with a child, and now having five children to care for, had decided to limit her family to this. However, despite the fact that the couple took \"precautions\", \"contraception was a very imperfect art in the nineteenth century\" resulting in the birth of three more children over the next four years.\n22 Hyde Park Gate (1882\u20131904)\n1882\u20131895\nVirginia Woolf provides insight into her early life in her autobiographical essays, including Reminiscences (1908), 22 Hyde Park Gate (1921), and A Sketch of the Past (1940). Other essays that provide insight into this period include Leslie Stephen (1932). She also alludes to her childhood in her fictional writing. In To the Lighthouse (1927), her depiction of the life of the Ramsays in the Hebrides is an only thinly disguised account of the Stephens in Cornwall and the Godrevy Lighthouse they would visit there. However, Woolf's understanding of her mother and family evolved considerably between 1907 and 1940, in which the somewhat distant, yet revered figure of her mother becomes more nuanced and filled in.\nIn February 1891, with her sister Vanessa, Woolf began the Hyde Park Gate News, chronicling life and events within the Stephen family, and modelled on the popular magazine Tit-Bits. Initially, this was mainly Vanessa's and Thoby's articles, but very soon Virginia became the main contributor, with Vanessa as editor. Their mother's response when it first appeared was \"Rather clever I think\". Virginia would run the Hyde Park Gate News until 1895, the time of her mother's death. The following year the Stephen sisters also used photography to supplement their insights, as did Stella Duckworth. Vanessa Bell's 1892 portrait of her sister and parents in the Library at Talland House (see image) was one of the family's favourites and was written about lovingly in Leslie Stephen's memoir. In 1897 (\"the first really lived year of my life)\" Virginia began her first diary, which she kept for the next twelve years, and a notebook in 1909.Virginia was, as she describes it, \"born into a large connection, born not of rich parents, but of well-to-do parents, born into a very communicative, literate, letter writing, visiting, articulate, late nineteenth century world\". It was a well-connected family consisting of six children, with two half brothers and a half sister (the Duckworths, from her mother's first marriage), another half sister, Laura (from her father's first marriage), and an older sister, Vanessa and brother Thoby. The following year, another brother Adrian followed. The disabled Laura Stephen lived with the family until she was institutionalised in 1891. Julia and Leslie had four children together:\nVanessa \"Nessa\" (30 May 1879 \u2013 1961), married Clive Bell in 1907\nThoby (9 September 1880 \u2013 1906), founded Bloomsbury Group\nVirginia \"Jinny\"\/\"Ginia\" (25 January 1882 \u2013 1941), married Leonard Woolf in 1912\nAdrian (27 October 1883 \u2013 1948), married Karin Costelloe in 1914\nVirginia was born at 22 Hyde Park Gate and lived there until her father's death in 1904. Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington, lay at the south-east end of Hyde Park Gate, a narrow cul-de-sac running south from Kensington Road, just west of the Royal Albert Hall, and opposite Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, where the family regularly took their walks (see Map; Street plan). Built in 1846 by Henry Payne of Hammersmith as one of a row of single-family townhouses for the upper middle class, it soon became too small for their expanding family. At the time of their marriage, it consisted of a basement, two stories, and an attic. In July 1886 Leslie Stephen obtained the services of J.\u00a0W. Penfold, an architect, to add additional living space above and behind the existing structure. The substantial renovations added a new top floor (see image of red brick extension), with three bedrooms and a study for himself, converted the original attic into rooms, and added the first bathroom. It was a tall but narrow townhouse, that at that time had no running water. Virginia would later describe it as \"a very tall house on the left-hand side near the bottom which begins by being stucco and ends by being red brick; which is so high and yet\u2014as I can say now that we have sold it\u2014so rickety that it seems as if a very high wind would topple it over\".\nThe servants worked \"downstairs\" in the basement. The ground floor had a drawing room, separated by a curtain from the servant's pantry and a library. Above this on the first floor were Julia and Leslie's bedrooms. On the next floor were the Duckworth children's rooms, and above them, the day and night nurseries of the Stephen children occupied two further floors. Finally, in the attic, under the eaves, were the servants' bedrooms, accessed by a back staircase. Life at 22 Hyde Park Gate was also divided symbolically; as Virginia put it, \"The division in our lives was curious. Downstairs there was pure convention: upstairs pure intellect. But there was no connection between them\", the worlds typified by George Duckworth and Leslie Stephen. Their mother, it seems, was the only one who could span this divide. The house was described as dimly lit and crowded with furniture and paintings. Within it, the younger Stephens formed a close-knit group. Despite this, the children still held their grievances. Virginia envied Adrian for being their mother's favourite. Virginia and Vanessa's status as creatives (writing and art respectively) caused a rivalry between them at times. Life in London differed sharply from their summers in Cornwall, their outdoor activities consisting mainly of walks in nearby Kensington Gardens, where they would play hide-and-seek and sail their boats on the Round Pond, while indoors, it revolved around their lessons.Leslie Stephen's eminence as an editor, critic, and biographer, and his connection to William Thackeray, meant his children were raised in an environment filled with the influences of a Victorian literary society. Henry James, George Henry Lewes, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Thomas Hardy, Edward Burne-Jones, and Virginia's honorary godfather, James Russell Lowell, were among the visitors to the house. Julia Stephen was equally well connected. Her aunt was a pioneering early photographer, Julia Margaret Cameron, who was also a visitor to the Stephen household. The two Stephen sisters, Vanessa and Virginia, were almost three years apart in age. Virginia christened her older sister \"the saint\" and was far more inclined to exhibit her cleverness than her more reserved sister. Virginia resented the domesticity Victorian tradition forced on them far more than her sister. They also competed for Thoby's affections. Virginia would later confess her ambivalence over this rivalry to Duncan Grant in 1917: \"indeed one of the concealed worms of my life has been a sister's jealousy \u2013 of a sister I mean; and to feed this I have invented such a myth about her that I scarce know one from t'other\".Virginia showed an early affinity for writing. Although both parents disapproved of formal education for females, writing was considered a respectable profession for women, and her father encouraged her in this respect. Later, she would describe this as \"ever since I was a little creature, scribbling a story in the manner of Hawthorne on the green plush sofa in the drawing room at St. Ives while the grown-ups dined\". By the age of five, she was writing letters and could tell her father a story every night. Later, she, Vanessa, and Adrian would develop the tradition of inventing a serial about their next-door neighbours, every night in the nursery, or in the case of St. Ives, of spirits that resided in the garden. It was her fascination with books that formed the strongest bond between her and her father. For her tenth birthday, she received an ink-stand, a blotter, drawing book and a box of writing implements.\nTalland House (1882\u20131894)\nLeslie Stephen was in the habit of hiking in Cornwall, and in the spring of 1881 he came across a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall, and took out a lease on it that September. Although it had limited amenities, its main attraction was the view overlooking Porthminster Bay towards the Godrevy Lighthouse, which the young Virginia could see from the upper windows and was to be the central figure in her To the Lighthouse (1927). It was a large square house, with a terraced garden, divided by hedges, sloping down towards the sea. Each year between 1882 and 1894 from mid-July to mid-September the Stephen family leased Talland House as a summer residence. Leslie Stephen, who referred to it thus: \"a pocket-paradise\", described it as \"The pleasantest of my memories... refer to our summers, all of which were passed in Cornwall, especially to the thirteen summers (1882\u20131894) at St Ives. There we bought the lease of Talland House: a small but roomy house, with a garden of an acre or two all up and down hill, with quaint little terraces divided by hedges of escallonia, a grape-house and kitchen-garden and a so-called 'orchard' beyond\". It was in Leslie's words, a place of \"intense domestic happiness\". Virginia herself described the house in great detail:\n\n\nIn both London and Cornwall, Julia was perpetually entertaining, and was notorious for her manipulation of her guests' lives, constantly matchmaking in the belief everyone should be married, the domestic equivalence of her philanthropy. As her husband observed, \"My Julia was of course, though with all due reserve, a bit of a matchmaker\". Amongst their guests in 1893 were the Brookes, whose children, including Rupert Brooke, played with the Stephen children. Rupert and his group of Cambridge Neo-pagans would come to play an important role in their lives in the years before the First World War. While Cornwall was supposed to be a summer respite, Julia Stephen soon immersed herself in the work of caring for the sick and poor there, as well as in London. Both at Hyde Park Gate and Talland House, the family mingled with much of the country's literary and artistic circles. Frequent guests included literary figures such as Henry James and George Meredith, as well as James Russell Lowell, and the children were exposed to much more intellectual conversations than at their mother's Little Holland House. The family did not return, following Julia Stephen's death in May 1895.For the children, it was the highlight of the year, and Virginia's most vivid childhood memories were not of London but of Cornwall. In a diary entry of 22 March 1921, she described why she felt so connected to Talland House, looking back to a summer day in August 1890. \"Why am I so incredibly and incurably romantic about Cornwall? One's past, I suppose; I see children running in the garden \u2026 The sound of the sea at night \u2026 almost forty years of life, all built on that, permeated by that: so much I could never explain\". Cornwall inspired aspects of her work, in particular the \"St Ives Trilogy\" of Jacob's Room (1922), To the Lighthouse (1927), and The Waves (1931).\n1895\u20131904\nJulia Stephen fell ill with influenza in February 1895, and never properly recovered, dying on 5 May, when Virginia was 13. This was a pivotal moment in her life and the beginning of her struggles with mental illness. Essentially, her life had fallen apart. The Duckworths were travelling abroad at the time of their mother's death, and Stella returned immediately to take charge and assume her role. That summer, rather than return to the memories of St Ives, the Stephens went to Freshwater, Isle of Wight, where some of their mother's relatives lived. It was there that Virginia had the first of her many nervous breakdowns, and Vanessa was forced to assume some of her mother's role in caring for Virginia's mental state. Stella became engaged to Jack Hills the following year and they were married on 10 April 1897, making Virginia even more dependent on her older sister.\nGeorge Duckworth also assumed some of their mother's role, taking upon himself the task of bringing them out into society. First Vanessa, then Virginia, in both cases an equal disaster, for it was not a rite of passage that resonated with either girl and attracted a scathing critique by Virginia regarding the conventional expectations of young upper-class women: \"Society in those days was a perfectly competent, perfectly complacent, ruthless machine. A girl had no chance against its fangs. No other desires \u2013 say to paint, or to write \u2013 could be taken seriously\". Rather her priorities were to escape from the Victorian conventionality of the downstairs drawing room to a \"room of one's own\" to pursue her writing aspirations. She would revisit this criticism in her depiction of Mrs. Ramsay stating the duties of a Victorian mother in To the Lighthouse \"an unmarried woman has missed the best of life\".The death of Stella Duckworth on 19 July 1897, after a long illness, was a further blow to Virginia's sense of self, and the family dynamics. Woolf described the period following the death of both her mother and Stella as \"1897\u20131904 \u2013 the seven unhappy years\", referring to \"the lash of a random unheeding flail that pointlessly and brutally killed the two people who should, normally and naturally, have made those years, not perhaps happy but normal and natural\". In April 1902, their father became ill, and although he underwent surgery later that year he never fully recovered, dying on 22 February 1904. Virginia's father's death precipitated a further breakdown. Later, Virginia would describe this time as one in which she was dealt successive blows as a \"broken chrysalis\" with wings still creased. Chrysalis occurs many times in Woolf's writing but the \"broken chrysalis\" was an image that became a metaphor for those exploring the relationship between Woolf and grief. At his death, Leslie Stephen's net worth was \u00a315,715 6s. 6d. (probate 23 March 1904)\nEducation\nIn the late 19th century, education was sharply divided along gender lines, a tradition that Virginia would note and condemn in her writing. Boys were sent to school, and in upper-middle-class families such as the Stephens, this involved private boys schools, often boarding schools, and university. Girls, if they were afforded the luxury of education, received it from their parents, governesses and tutors. Virginia was educated by her parents who shared the duty. There was a small classroom off the back of the drawing room, with its many windows, which they found perfect for quiet writing and painting. Julia taught the children Latin, French and History, while Leslie taught them mathematics. They also received piano lessons. Supplementing their lessons was the children's unrestricted access to Leslie Stephen's vast library, exposing them to much of the literary canon, resulting in a greater depth of reading than any of their Cambridge contemporaries, Virginia's reading being described as \"greedy\". Later, she would recall Even today there may be parents who would doubt the wisdom of allowing a girl of fifteen the free run of a large and quite unexpurgated library. But my father allowed it. There were certain facts \u2013 very briefly, very shyly he referred to them. Yet \"Read what you like\", he said, and all his books...were to be had without asking. After public school, the boys in the family all attended Cambridge University. The girls derived some indirect benefit from this, as the boys introduced them to their friends. Another source was the conversation of their father's friends, to whom they were exposed. Leslie Stephen described his circle as \"most of the literary people of mark...clever young writers and barristers, chiefly of the radical persuasion...we used to meet on Wednesday and Sunday evenings, to smoke and drink and discuss the universe and the reform movement\".\nLater, between the ages of 15 and 19, Virginia was able to pursue higher education. She took courses of study, some at degree level, in beginning and advanced Ancient Greek, intermediate Latin and German, together with continental and English history at the Ladies' Department of King's College London at nearby 13 Kensington Square between 1897 and 1901. She studied Greek under the eminent scholar George Charles Winter Warr, professor of Classical Literature at King's. In addition she had private tutoring in German, Greek and Latin. One of her Greek tutors was Clara Pater (1899\u20131900), who taught at King's. Another was Janet Case, who involved her in the women's rights movement, and whose obituary Virginia would later write in 1937. Her experiences there led to her 1925 essay \"On Not Knowing Greek\". Her time at King's also brought her into contact with some of the early reformers of women's higher education such as the principal of the Ladies' Department, Lilian Faithfull (one of the so-called steamboat ladies), in addition to Pater. Her sister Vanessa also enrolled at the Ladies' Department (1899\u20131901). Although the Stephen girls could not attend Cambridge, they were to be profoundly influenced by their brothers' experiences there. When Thoby went up to Trinity in 1899, he befriended a circle of young men, including Clive Bell, Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf (whom Virginia would later marry) and Saxon Sydney-Turner, that he would soon introduce to his sisters at the Trinity May Ball in 1900. These men formed a reading group they named the Midnight Society.\nRelationships with family\nAlthough Virginia expressed the opinion her father was her favourite parent, and although she had only turned thirteen when her mother died, she was profoundly influenced by her mother throughout her life. It was Virginia who famously stated that \"for we think back through our mothers if we are women\", and invoked the image of her mother repeatedly throughout her life in her diaries, her letters and a number of her autobiographical essays, including Reminiscences (1908), 22 Hyde Park Gate (1921) and A Sketch of the Past (1940), frequently evoking her memories with the words \"I see her ...\". She also alludes to her childhood in her fictional writing. In To the Lighthouse (1927), the artist, Lily Briscoe, attempts to paint Mrs. Ramsay, a complex character based on Julia Stephen, and repeatedly comments on the fact that she was \"astonishingly beautiful\". Her depiction of the life of the Ramsays in the Hebrides is an only thinly disguised account of the Stephens in Cornwall and the Godrevy Lighthouse they would visit there. However, Woolf's understanding of her mother and family evolved considerably between 1907 and 1940, in which the somewhat distant, yet revered figure becomes more nuanced and filled in.While her father painted Julia Stephen's work in terms of reverence, Woolf drew a sharp distinction between her mother's work and \"the mischievous philanthropy which other women practise so complacently and often with such disastrous results\". She describes her degree of sympathy, engagement, judgement and decisiveness, and her sense of both irony and the absurd. She recalls trying to recapture \"the clear round voice, or the sight of the beautiful figure, so upright and distinct, in its long shabby cloak, with the head held at a certain angle, so that the eye looked straight out at you\". Julia Stephen dealt with her husband's depressions and his need for attention, which created resentment in her children, boosted his self-confidence, nursed her parents in their final illness, and had many commitments outside the home that would eventually wear her down. Her frequent absences and the demands of her husband instilled a sense of insecurity in her children that had a lasting effect on her daughters. In considering the demands on her mother, Woolf described her father as \"fifteen years her elder, difficult, exacting, dependent on her\" and reflected that this was at the expense of the amount of attention she could spare her young children, \"a general presence rather than a particular person to a child\", reflecting that she rarely ever spent a moment alone with her mother, \"someone was always interrupting\". Woolf was ambivalent about all this, yet eager to separate herself from this model of utter selflessness. In To the Lighthouse, she describes it as \"boasting of her capacity to surround and protect, there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know herself by; all was so lavished and spent\". At the same time, she admired the strengths of her mother's womanly ideals. Given Julia's frequent absences and commitments, the young Stephen children became increasingly dependent on Stella Duckworth, who emulated her mother's selflessness, as Woolf wrote \"Stella was always the beautiful attendant handmaid ... making it the central duty of her life\".Julia Stephen greatly admired her husband's intellect. As Woolf observed \"she never belittled her own works, thinking them, if properly discharged, of equal, though other, importance with her husband's\". She believed with certainty in her role as the centre of her activities, and the person who held everything together, with a firm sense of what was important and valuing devotion. Of the two parents, Julia's \"nervous energy dominated the family\". While Virginia identified most closely with her father, Vanessa stated her mother was her favourite parent. Angelica Garnett recalls how Virginia asked Vanessa which parent she preferred, although Vanessa considered it a question that \"one ought not to ask\", she was unequivocal in answering \"Mother\" yet the centrality of her mother to Virginia's world is expressed in this description of her \"Certainly there she was, in the very centre of that great Cathedral space which was childhood; there she was from the very first\". Virginia observed that her half-sister, Stella, the oldest daughter, led a life of total subservience to her mother, incorporating her ideals of love and service. Virginia quickly learned, that like her father, being ill was the only reliable way of gaining the attention of her mother, who prided herself on her sickroom nursing.Another issue the children had to deal with was Leslie Stephen's temper, Woolf describing him as \"the tyrant father\". Eventually, she became deeply ambivalent about her father. He had given her his ring on her eighteenth birthday and she had a deep emotional attachment as his literary heir, writing about her \"great devotion for him\". Yet, like Vanessa, she also saw him as victimiser and tyrant. She had a lasting ambivalence towards him through her life, albeit one that evolved. Her adolescent image was of an \"Eminent Victorian\" and tyrant but as she grew older she began to realise how much of him was in her \"I have been dipping into old letters and father's memoirs....so candid and reasonable and transparent\u2014and had such a fastidious delicate mind, educated, and transparent\", she wrote (22 December 1940). She was in turn both fascinated and condemnatory of Leslie Stephen \" She [her mother] has haunted me: but then, so did that old wretch my father. . . . I was more like him than her, I think; and therefore more critical: but he was an adorable man, and somehow, tremendous\".\nSexual abuse\nMuch has been made of Virginia's statements that she was continually sexually abused during the whole time that she lived at 22 Hyde Park Gate, as a possible cause of her mental health issues, although there are likely to be a number of contributing factors. She states that she first remembers being molested by Gerald Duckworth when she was six years old. It has been suggested that this led to a lifetime of sexual fear and resistance to\nmasculine authority. Against a background of over-committed and distant parents, suggestions that this was a dysfunctional family must be evaluated. These include evidence of sexual abuse of the Stephen girls by their older Duckworth stepbrothers, and by their cousin, James Kenneth Stephen (1859\u20131892), at least of Stella Duckworth. Laura is also thought to have been abused. The most graphic account is by Louise DeSalvo, but other authors and reviewers have been more cautious. Lee states that, \"The evidence is strong enough, and yet ambiguous enough, to open the way for conflicting psychobiographical interpretations that draw quite different shapes of Virginia Woolf's interior life\".\nBloomsbury (1904\u20131940)\nGordon Square (1904\u20131907)\nOn their father's death, the Stephens' first instinct was to escape from the dark house of yet more mourning, and this they did immediately, accompanied by George, travelling to Manorbier, on the coast of Pembrokeshire on 27 February. There, they spent a month, and it was there that Virginia first came to realise her destiny was as a writer, as she recalls in her diary of 3 September 1922. They then further pursued their new found freedom by spending April in Italy and France, where they met up with Clive Bell again. Virginia then suffered her second nervous breakdown, and first suicidal attempt on 10 May, and convalesced over the next three months.Before their father died, the Stephens had discussed the need to leave South Kensington in the West End, with its tragic memories and their parents' relations. George Duckworth was 35, his brother Gerald 33. The Stephen children were now between 24 and 20. Virginia was 22. Vanessa and Adrian decided to sell 22 Hyde Park Gate in respectable South Kensington and move to Bloomsbury. Bohemian Bloomsbury, with its characteristic leafy squares seemed sufficiently far away, geographically and socially, and was a much cheaper neighbourhood to rent in. They had not inherited much and they were unsure about their finances. Also, Bloomsbury was close to the Slade School which Vanessa was then attending. While Gerald was quite happy to move on and find himself a bachelor establishment, George who had always assumed the role of quasi-parent decided to accompany them, much to their dismay. It was then that Lady Margaret Herbert appeared on the scene, George proposed, was accepted and married in September, leaving the Stephens to their own devices.Vanessa found a house at 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury, and they moved in November, to be joined by Virginia now sufficiently recovered. It was at Gordon Square that the Stephens began to regularly entertain Thoby's intellectual friends in March 1905. The circle, which largely came from the Cambridge Apostles, included writers (Saxon Sydney-Turner, Lytton Strachey) and critics (Clive Bell, Desmond MacCarthy) with Thursday evening \"At Homes\" that became known as the Thursday Club, a vision of recreating Trinity College (\"Cambridge in London\"). This circle formed the nucleus of the intellectual circle of writers and artists known as the Bloomsbury Group. Later, it would include John Maynard Keynes (1907), Duncan Grant (1908), E.M. Forster (1910), Roger Fry (1910), Leonard Woolf (1911) and David Garnett (1914).\n\nIn 1905, Virginia and Adrian visited Portugal and Spain. Clive Bell proposed to Vanessa, but was declined, while Virginia began teaching evening classes at Morley College and Vanessa added another event to their calendar with the Friday Club, dedicated to the discussion of and later exhibition of the fine arts. This introduced some new people into their circle, including Vanessa's friends from the Royal Academy and Slade, such as Henry Lamb and Gwen Darwin (who became secretary), but also the eighteen-year-old Katherine Laird (\"Ka\") Cox (1887\u20131938), who was about to go up to Newnham. Although Virginia did not actually meet Ka until much later, Ka would come to play an important part in her life. Ka and others brought the Bloomsbury Group into contact with another, slightly younger, group of Cambridge intellectuals to whom the Stephen sisters gave the name \"Neo-pagans\". The Friday Club continued until 1913.The following year, 1906, Virginia suffered two further losses. Her cherished brother Thoby, who was only 26, died of typhoid, following a trip they had all taken to Greece, and immediately after Vanessa accepted Clive's third proposal. Vanessa and Clive were married in February 1907 and as a couple, their interest in avant-garde art would have an important influence on Woolf's further development as an author. With Vanessa's marriage, Virginia and Adrian needed to find a new home.\nFitzroy Square (1907\u20131911)\nVirginia moved into 29 Fitzroy Square in April 1907, a house on the west side of the street, formerly occupied by George Bernard Shaw. It was in Fitzrovia, immediately to the west of Bloomsbury but still relatively close to her sister at Gordon Square. The two sisters continued to travel together, visiting Paris in March. Adrian was now to play a much larger part in Virginia's life, and they resumed the Thursday Club in October at their new home, while Gordon Square became the venue for the Play Reading Society in December. During this period, the group began to increasingly explore progressive ideas, first in speech, and then in conduct, Vanessa proclaiming in 1910 a libertarian society with sexual freedom for all.Meanwhile, Virginia began work on her first novel, Melymbrosia, that eventually became The Voyage Out (1915). Vanessa's first child, Julian was born in February 1908, and in September Virginia accompanied the Bells to Italy and France. It was during this time that Virginia's rivalry with her sister resurfaced, flirting with Clive, which he reciprocated, and which lasted on and off from 1908 to 1914, by which time her sister's marriage was breaking down. On 17 February 1909, Lytton Strachey proposed to Virginia and she accepted, but he then withdrew the offer.It was while she was at Fitzroy Square that the question arose of Virginia needing a quiet country retreat, and she required a six-week rest cure and sought the countryside away from London as much as possible. In December, she and Adrian stayed at Lewes and started exploring the area of Sussex around the town. She started to want a place of her own, like St Ives, but closer to London. She soon found a property in nearby Firle (see below), maintaining a relationship with that area for the rest of her life.\nDreadnought hoax 1910\nSeveral members of the group attained notoriety in 1910 with the Dreadnought hoax, which Virginia participated in disguised as a male Abyssinian royal. Her complete 1940 talk on the hoax was discovered and is published in the memoirs collected in the expanded edition of The Platform of Time (2008).\nBrunswick Square (1911\u20131912)\nIn October 1911, the lease on Fitzroy Square was running out and Virginia and Adrian decided to give up their home on Fitzroy Square in favour of a different living arrangement, moving to a four-storied house at 38 Brunswick Square in Bloomsbury proper in November. Virginia saw it as a new opportunity; \"We are going to try all kinds of experiments\", she told Ottoline Morrell. Adrian occupied the second floor, with Maynard Keynes and Duncan Grant sharing the ground floor. This arrangement for a single woman was considered scandalous, and George Duckworth was horrified. The house was adjacent to the Foundling Hospital, much to Virginia's amusement as an unchaperoned single woman. Originally, Ka Cox was supposed to share in the arrangements, but opposition came from Rupert Brooke, who was involved with her and pressured her to abandon the idea. At the house, Duncan Grant decorated Adrian Stephen's rooms (see image).\nMarriage (1912\u20131941)\nLeonard Woolf was one of Thoby Stephen's friends at Trinity College, Cambridge, and noticed the Stephen sisters in Thoby's rooms there on their visits to the May Ball in 1900 and 1901. He recalls them in \"white dresses and large hats, with parasols in their hands, their beauty literally took one's breath away\". To him, they were silent, \"formidable and alarming\".Woolf did not meet Virginia formally till 17 November 1904 when he dined with the Stephens at Gordon Square, to say goodbye before leaving to take up a position with the civil service in Ceylon, although she was aware of him through Thoby's stories. At that visit he noted that she was perfectly silent throughout the meal, and looked ill. In 1909, Lytton Strachey suggested to Woolf he should make her an offer of marriage. He did so, but received no answer. In June 1911, he returned to London on a one-year leave, but did not go back to Ceylon. In England again, Leonard renewed his contacts with family and friends. Three weeks after arriving he dined with Vanessa and Clive Bell at Gordon Square on 3 July, where they were later joined by Virginia and other members of what would later be called \"Bloomsbury\", and Leonard dates the group's formation to that night. In September, Virginia asked Leonard to join her at Little Talland House at Firle in Sussex for a long weekend. After that weekend, they began seeing each other more frequently.On 4 December 1911, Leonard moved into the m\u00e9nage on Brunswick Square, occupying a bedroom and sitting room on the fourth floor, and started to see Virginia constantly and by the end of the month had decided he was in love with her. On 11 January 1912, he proposed to her; she asked for time to consider, so he asked for an extension of his leave and, on being refused, offered his resignation on 25 April, effective 20 May. He continued to pursue Virginia, and in a letter of 1 May 1912 (which see) she explained why she did not favour a marriage. However, on 29 May, Virginia told Leonard that she wished to marry him, and they were married on 10 August at the St Pancras Register Office. It was during this time that Leonard first became aware of Virginia's precarious mental state. The Woolfs continued to live at Brunswick Square until October 1912, when they moved to a small flat at 13 Clifford's Inn, further to the east (subsequently demolished). Despite his low material status (Woolf referring to Leonard during their engagement as a \"penniless Jew\"), the couple shared a close bond. Indeed, in 1937, Woolf wrote in her diary: \"Love-making\u2014after 25 years can't bear to be separate ... you see it is enormous pleasure being wanted: a wife. And our marriage so complete.\" However, Virginia made a suicide attempt in 1913.In October 1914, Leonard and Virginia Woolf moved away from Bloomsbury and central London to Richmond, living at 17 The Green, a home discussed by Leonard in his autobiography Beginning Again (1964). In early March 1915, the couple moved again, to nearby Hogarth House, Paradise Road, after which they named their publishing house. Virginia's first novel, The Voyage Out was published in 1915, followed by another suicide attempt. Despite the introduction of conscription in 1916, Leonard was exempted on medical grounds.Between 1924 and 1940, the Woolfs returned to Bloomsbury, taking out a ten-year lease at 52 Tavistock Square, from where they ran the Hogarth Press from the basement, where Virginia also had her writing room, and is commemorated with a bust of her in the square (see illustration). 1925 saw the publication of Mrs Dalloway in May followed by her collapse while at Charleston in August. In 1927, her next novel, To the Lighthouse, was published, and the following year she lectured on Women & Fiction at Cambridge University and published Orlando in October. Her two Cambridge lectures then became the basis for her major essay A Room of One's Own in 1929. Virginia wrote only one drama, Freshwater, based on her great-aunt Julia Margaret Cameron, and produced at her sister's studio on Fitzroy Street in 1935. 1936 saw another collapse of her health following the completion of The Years.The Woolf's final residence in London was at 37 Mecklenburgh Square (1939\u20131940), destroyed during the Blitz in September 1940; a month later their previous home on Tavistock Square was also destroyed. After that, they made Sussex their permanent home. For descriptions and illustrations of all Virginia Woolf's London homes, see Jean Moorcroft Wilson's book Virginia Woolf, Life and London: A Biography of Place (pub. Cecil Woolf, 1987).\nHogarth Press (1917\u20131938)\n\nVirginia had taken up book-binding as a pastime in October 1901, at the age of 19, and the Woolfs had been discussing setting up a publishing house for some time, and at the end of 1916 started making plans. Having discovered that they were not eligible to enroll in the St Bride School of Printing, they started purchasing supplies after seeking advice from the Excelsior Printing Supply Company on Farringdon Road in March 1917, and soon they had a printing press set up on their dining room table at Hogarth House, and the Hogarth Press was born.Their first publication was Two Stories in July 1917, inscribed Publication No. 1, and consisted of two short stories, \"The Mark on the Wall\" by Virginia Woolf and Three Jews by Leonard Woolf. The work consisted of 32 pages, hand bound and sewn, and illustrated by woodcuts designed by Dora Carrington. The illustrations were a success, leading Virginia to remark that the press was \"specially good at printing pictures, and we see that we must make a practice of always having pictures\" (13 July 1917). The process took two and a half months with a production run of 150 copies. Other short short stories followed, including Kew Gardens (1919) with a woodblock by Vanessa Bell as frontispiece. Subsequently, Bell added further illustrations, adorning each page of the text.The press subsequently published Virginia's novels along with works by T.S. Eliot, Laurens van der Post, and others. The Press also commissioned works by contemporary artists, including Dora Carrington and Vanessa Bell. Woolf believed that to break free of a patriarchal society women writers needed a \"room of their own\" to develop and often fantasised about an \"Outsider's Society\" where women writers would create a virtual private space for themselves via their writings to develop a feminist critique of society. Though Woolf never created the \"Outsider's society\", the Hogarth Press was the closest approximation as the Woolfs chose to publish books by writers that took unconventional points of view to form a reading community. Initially the press concentrated on small experimental publications, of little interest to large commercial publishers. Until 1930, Woolf often helped her husband print the Hogarth books as the money for employees was not there. Virginia relinquished her interest in 1938, following a third attempted suicide. After it was bombed in September 1940, the press was moved to Letchworth for the remainder of the war. Both the Woolfs were internationalists and pacifists who believed that promoting understanding between peoples was the best way to avoid another world war and chose quite consciously to publish works by foreign authors of whom the British reading public were unaware. The first non-British author to be published was the Soviet writer Maxim Gorky, the book Reminiscences of Leo Nikolaiovich Tolstoy in 1920, dealing with his friendship with Count Leo Tolstoy.\nMemoir Club (1920\u20131941)\n\n1920 saw a postwar reconstitution of the Bloomsbury Group, under the title of the Memoir Club, which as the name suggests focussed on self-writing, in the manner of Proust's A La Recherche, and inspired some of the more influential books of the 20th century. The Group, which had been scattered by the war, was reconvened by Mary ('Molly') MacCarthy who called them \"Bloomsberries\", and operated under rules derived from the Cambridge Apostles, an elite university debating society that a number of them had been members of. These rules emphasised candour and openness. Among the 125 memoirs presented, Virginia contributed three that were published posthumously in 1976, in the autobiographical anthology Moments of Being. These were 22 Hyde Park Gate (1921), Old Bloomsbury (1922) and Am I a Snob? (1936).\nVita Sackville-West (1922\u20131941)\nThe ethos of the Bloomsbury group encouraged a liberal approach to sexuality, and on 14 December 1922 Woolf met the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson, while dining with Clive Bell. Writing in her diary the next day, she referred to meeting \"the lovely gifted aristocratic Sackville West\". At the time, Sackville-West was the more successful writer as both poet and novelist, commercially and critically, and it was not until after Woolf's death that she became considered the better writer. After a tentative start, they began a sexual relationship, which, according to Sackville-West in a letter to her husband on 17 August 1926, was only twice consummated. The relationship reached its peak between 1925 and 1928, evolving into more of a friendship through the 1930s, though Woolf was also inclined to brag of her affairs with other women within her intimate circle, such as Sibyl Colefax and Comtesse de Polignac. This period of intimacy was to prove fruitful for both authors, Woolf producing three novels, To the Lighthouse (1927), Orlando (1928) and The Waves (1931) as well as a number of essays, including \"Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown\" (1924) and \"A Letter to a Young Poet\" (1932).Sackville-West worked tirelessly to lift Woolf's self-esteem, encouraging her not to view herself as a quasi-reclusive inclined to sickness who should hide herself away from the world, but rather offered praise for her liveliness and wit, her health, her intelligence and achievements as a writer. Sackville-West led Woolf to reappraise herself, developing a more positive self-image, and the feeling that her writings were the products of her strengths rather than her weakness. Starting at the age of 15, Woolf had believed the diagnosis by her father and his doctor that reading and writing were deleterious to her nervous condition, requiring a regime of physical labour such as gardening to prevent a total nervous collapse. This led Woolf to spend much time obsessively engaging in such physical labour.Sackville-West was the first to argue to Woolf she had been misdiagnosed, and that it was far better to engage in reading and writing to calm her nerves\u2014advice that was taken. Under the influence of Sackville-West, Woolf learned to deal with her nervous ailments by switching between various forms of intellectual activities such as reading, writing and book reviews, instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength and worsened her nerves. Sackville-West chose the financially struggling Hogarth Press as her publisher to assist the Woolfs financially. Seducers in Ecuador, the first of the novels by Sackville-West published by Hogarth, was not a success, selling only 1500 copies in its first year, but the next Sackville-West novel they published, The Edwardians, was a best-seller that sold 30,000 copies in its first six months. Sackville-West's novels, though not typical of the Hogarth Press, saved Hogarth, taking them from the red into the black. However, Woolf was not always appreciative of the fact that it was Sackville-West's books that kept the Hogarth Press profitable, writing dismissively in 1933 of her \"servant girl\" novels. The financial security allowed by the good sales of Sackville-West's novels in turn allowed Woolf to engage in more experimental work, such as The Waves, as Woolf had to be cautious when she depended upon Hogarth entirely for her income.In 1928, Woolf presented Sackville-West with Orlando, a fantastical biography in which the eponymous hero's life spans three centuries and both sexes. It was published in October, shortly after the two women spent a week travelling together in France, that September. Nigel Nicolson, Vita Sackville-West's son, wrote, \"The effect of Vita on Virginia is all contained in Orlando, the longest and most charming love letter in literature, in which she explores Vita, weaves her in and out of the centuries, tosses her from one sex to the other, plays with her, dresses her in furs, lace and emeralds, teases her, flirts with her, drops a veil of mist around her.\" After their affair ended, the two women remained friends until Woolf's death in 1941. Virginia Woolf also remained close to her surviving siblings, Adrian and Vanessa; Thoby had died of typhoid fever at the age of 26.\nSussex (1911\u20131941)\nVirginia was needing a country retreat to escape to, and on 24 December 1910, she found a house for rent in Firle, Sussex, near Lewes (see Map). She obtained a lease and took possession of the house the following month, naming it 'Little Talland House', after their childhood home in Cornwall, although it was actually a new red gabled villa on the main street opposite the village hall. The lease was a short one, and in October, she and Leonard Woolf found Asham House at Asheham a few miles to the west, while walking along the Ouse from Firle. The house, at the end of a tree-lined road was a strange beautiful Regency-Gothic house in a lonely location. She described it as \"flat, pale, serene, yellow-washed\", without electricity or water and allegedly haunted. She took out a five-year lease jointly with Vanessa in the New Year, and they moved into it in February 1912, holding a house warming party on the 9th.It was at Asham that the Woolfs spent their wedding night later that year. At Asham, she recorded the events of the weekends and holidays they spent there in her Asham Diary, part of which was later published as A Writer's Diary in 1953. In terms of creative writing, The Voyage Out was completed there, and much of Night and Day. Asham provided Woolf with well needed relief from the pace of London life and was where she found a happiness that she expressed in her diary of 5 May 1919 \"Oh, but how happy we've been at Asheham! It was a most melodious time. Everything went so freely; \u2013 but I can't analyse all the sources of my joy\". Asham was also the inspiration for A Haunted House (1921\u20131944), and was painted by members of the Bloomsbury Group, including Vanessa Bell and Roger Fry. It was during these times at Asham that Ka Cox (seen here) started to devote herself to Virginia and become very useful.\n\nWhile at Asham Leonard and Virginia found a farmhouse in 1916, that was to let, about four miles away, which they thought would be ideal for her sister. Eventually, Vanessa came down to inspect it, and moved in in October of that year, taking it as a summer home for her family. The Charleston Farmhouse was to become the summer gathering place for the literary and artistic circle of the Bloomsbury Group.After the end of the war, in 1918, the Woolfs were given a year's notice by the landlord, who needed the house. In mid-1919, \"in despair\", they purchased \"a very strange little house\" for \u00a3300, the Round House in Pipe Passage, Lewes, a converted windmill. No sooner had they bought the Round House, than Monk's House in nearby Rodmell, came up for auction, a weatherboarded house with oak beamed rooms, said to be 15th or 16th century. The Leonards favoured the latter because of its orchard and garden, and sold the Round House, to purchase Monk's House for \u00a3700. Monk's House also lacked water and electricity, but came with an acre of garden, and had a view across the Ouse towards the hills of the South Downs. Leonard Woolf describes this view (and the amenities) as being unchanged since the days of Chaucer. From 1940, it became their permanent home after their London home was bombed, and Virginia continued to live there until her death. Meanwhile, Vanessa made Charleston her permanent home in 1936. It was at Monk's House that Virginia completed Between the Acts in early 1941, followed by a further breakdown directly resulting in her suicide on 28 March 1941, the novel being published posthumously later that year.\nThe Neo-pagans (1911\u20131912)\nDuring her time in Firle, Virginia became better acquainted with Rupert Brooke and his group of Neo-Pagans, pursuing socialism, vegetarianism, exercising outdoors and alternative life styles, including social nudity. They were influenced by the ethos of Bedales, Fabianism and Shelley. The women wore sandals, socks, open neck shirts and head-scarves. Although she had some reservations, Woolf was involved with their activities for a while, fascinated by their bucolic innocence in contrast to the sceptical intellectualism of Bloomsbury, which earned her the nickname \"The Goat\" from her brother Adrian. While Woolf liked to make much of a weekend she spent with Brooke at the vicarage in Grantchester, including swimming in the pool there, it appears to have been principally a literary assignation. They also shared a psychiatrist in the name of Maurice Craig. Through the Neo-Pagans, she finally met Ka Cox on a weekend in Oxford in January 1911, who had been part of the Friday Club circle and now became her friend and played an important part in dealing with her illnesses. Virginia nicknamed her \"Bruin\". At the same time, she found herself dragged into a triangular relationship involving Ka, Jacques Raverat and Gwen Darwin. She became resentful of the other couple, Jacques and Gwen, who married later in 1911, not the outcome Virginia had predicted or desired. They would later be referred to in both To the Lighthouse and The Years. The exclusion she felt evoked memories of both Stella Duckworth's marriage and her triangular involvement with Vanessa and Clive.The two groups eventually fell out. Brooke pressured Ka into withdrawing from joining Virginia's m\u00e9nage on Brunswick Square in late 1911, calling it a \"bawdy-house\" and by the end of 1912 he had vehemently turned against Bloomsbury. Later, she would write sardonically about Brooke, whose premature death resulted in his idealisation, and express regret about \"the Neo-Paganism at that stage of my life\". Virginia was deeply disappointed when Ka married William Edward Arnold-Forster in 1918, and became increasingly critical of her.\nMental health\nMuch examination has been made of Woolf's mental health (e.g., see Mental health bibliography). From the age of 13, following the death of her mother, Woolf suffered periodic mood swings from severe depression to manic excitement, including psychotic episodes, which the family referred to as her \"madness\". However, as Hermione Lee points out, Woolf was not \"mad\"; she was merely a woman who suffered from and struggled with illness for much of her relatively short life, a woman of \"exceptional courage, intelligence and stoicism\", who made the best use, and achieved the best understanding she could of that illness.Psychiatrists today consider that her illness constitutes bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness). Her mother's death in 1895, \"the greatest disaster that could happen\", precipitated a crisis of alternating excitability and depression accompanied by irrational fears, for which their family doctor, Dr. Seton, prescribed rest, stopping lessons and writing, and regular walks supervised by Stella. Yet just two years later, Stella too was dead, bringing on her next crisis in 1897, and her first expressed wish for death at the age of fifteen, writing in her diary that October that \"death would be shorter & less painful\". She then stopped keeping a diary for some time. This was a scenario she would later recreate in \"Time Passes\" (To the Lighthouse, 1927).The death of her father in 1904 provoked her most alarming collapse, on 10 May, when she threw herself out of a window and she was briefly institutionalised under the care of her father's friend, the eminent psychiatrist George Savage. Savage blamed her education\u2014frowned on by many at the time as unsuitable for women\u2014for her illness. She spent time recovering at the house of Stella's friend Violet Dickinson, and at her aunt Caroline's house in Cambridge, and by January 1905, Dr Savage considered her \"cured\". Violet, seventeen years older than Virginia, became one of her closest friends and one of her more effective nurses. She characterised this as a \"romantic friendship\" (Letter to Violet 4 May 1903). Her brother Thoby's death in 1906 marked a \"decade of deaths\u201d that ended her childhood and adolescence. From then on, her life was punctuated by urgent voices from the grave, that at times seemed more real than her visual reality.On Dr. Savage's recommendation, Virginia spent three short periods in 1910, 1912, and 1913 at Burley House at 15 Cambridge Park, Twickenham (see image), described as \"a private nursing home for women with nervous disorder\" run by Miss Jean Thomas. By the end of February 1910, she was becoming increasingly restless, and Dr. Savage suggested being away from London. Vanessa rented Moat House, outside Canterbury, in June, but there was no improvement, so Dr. Savage sent her to Burley for a \"rest cure\". This involved partial isolation, deprivation of literature, and force-feeding, and after six weeks she was able to convalesce in Cornwall and Dorset during the autumn. \nShe loathed the experience; writing to her sister on 28 July, she described how she found the phony religious atmosphere stifling and the institution ugly, and informed Vanessa that to escape \"I shall soon have to jump out of a window.\" The threat of being sent back would later lead to her contemplating suicide. Despite her protests, Savage would refer her back in 1912 for insomnia and in 1913 for depression. \nOn emerging from Burley House in September 1913, she sought further opinions from two other physicians on the 13th, Maurice Wright, and Henry Head, who had been Henry James' physician. Both recommended she return to Burley House. Distraught, she returned home and attempted suicide by taking an overdose of 100 grains of veronal (a barbiturate) and nearly dying, had she not been found by Ka Cox, who summoned help. \nOn recovery, she went to Dalingridge Hall, George Duckworth's home in East Grinstead, Sussex, to convalesce on 30 September, accompanied by Ka Cox and a nurse, returning to Asham on 18 November with Cox and Janet Case. She remained unstable over the next two years, with another incident involving veronal that she claimed was an \"accident\", and consulted another psychiatrist in April 1914, Maurice Craig, who explained that she was not sufficiently psychotic to be certified or committed to an institution. \nThe rest of the summer of 1914 went better for her, and they moved to Richmond, but in February 1915, just as The Voyage Out was due to be published, she relapsed once more, and remained in poor health for most of that year. Then, despite Miss Thomas's gloomy prognosis, she began to recover, following 20 years of ill health. Nevertheless, there was a feeling among those around her that she was now permanently changed, and not for the better.Over the rest of her life, she suffered recurrent bouts of depression. In 1940, a number of factors appeared to overwhelm her. Her biography of Roger Fry had been published in July, and she had been disappointed in its reception. The horrors of war depressed her, and their London homes had been destroyed in the Blitz in September and October. Woolf had completed Between the Acts (published posthumously in 1941) in November, and completing a novel was frequently accompanied by exhaustion. Her health became increasingly a matter of concern, culminating in her decision to end her life on 28 March 1941.Though this instability would frequently affect her social life, she was able to continue her literary productivity with few interruptions throughout her life. Woolf herself provides not only a vivid picture of her symptoms in her diaries and letters, but also her response to the demons that haunted her and at times made her long for death: \"But it is always a question whether I wish to avoid these glooms... These 9 weeks give one a plunge into deep waters... One goes down into the well & nothing protects one from the assault of truth.\"Psychiatry had little to offer her in her lifetime, but she recognised that writing was one of the behaviours that enabled her to cope with her illness:  \"The only way I keep afloat... is by working... Directly I stop working I feel that I am sinking down, down. And as usual, I feel that if I sink further I shall reach the truth.\" Sinking under water was Woolf's metaphor for both the effects of depression and psychosis\u2014 but also for finding truth, and ultimately was her choice of death.Throughout her life, Woolf struggled, without success, to find meaning in her illness: on the one hand, an impediment, on the other, something she visualised as an essential part of who she was, and a necessary condition of her art. When she was able to control her illness, it informed her work, such as the character of Septimus Warren Smith in Mrs Dalloway (1925), who, like Woolf, was haunted by the dead, and ultimately takes his own life rather than be admitted to a sanitorium.Leonard Woolf relates how during the 30 years they were married, they consulted many doctors in the Harley Street area, and although they were given a diagnosis of neurasthenia, he felt they had little understanding of the causes or nature. The solution was simple\u2014as long as she lived a quiet life without any physical or mental exertion, she was well. On the other hand, any mental, emotional, or physical strain resulted in a reappearance of her symptoms. These began with a headache, followed by insomnia and thoughts that started to race. Her remedy was simple, to retire to bed in a darkened room, eat, and drink plenty of milk, following which the symptoms slowly subsided.Modern scholars, including her nephew and biographer, Quentin Bell, have suggested her breakdowns and subsequent recurring depressive periods were influenced by the sexual abuse which she and her sister Vanessa were subjected to by their half-brothers George and Gerald Duckworth (which Woolf recalls in her autobiographical essays \"A Sketch of the Past\" and \"22 Hyde Park Gate\") (see Sexual abuse). Biographers point out that when Stella died in 1897, there was no counterbalance to control George's predation, and his nighttime prowling. Virginia describes him as her first lover, \"The old ladies of Kensington and Belgravia never knew that George Duckworth was not only father and mother, brother and sister to those poor Stephen girls; he was their lover also.\"It is likely that other factors also played a part. It has been suggested that these include genetic predisposition, for both trauma and family history have been implicated in bipolar disorder. Virginia's father, Leslie Stephen, suffered from depression, and her half-sister Laura was institutionalised. Many of Virginia's symptoms, including persistent headache, insomnia, irritability, and anxiety resemble those of her father. Another factor is the pressure she placed upon herself in her work; for instance, her breakdown of 1913 was at least partly triggered by the need to finish The Voyage Out.Virginia herself hinted that her illness was related to how she saw the repressed position of women in society, when she wrote in A Room of One's Own that had Shakespeare had a sister of equal genius, she \"would certainly have gone crazed, shot herself, or ended her days in some lonely cottage outside the village, half witch, half wizard, feared and mocked at\". These inspirations emerged from what Woolf referred to as her lava of madness, describing her time at Burley in a 1930 letter to Ethel Smyth:\n\nAs an experience, madness is terrific I can assure you, and not to be sniffed at; and in its lava I still find most of the things I write about. It shoots out of one everything shaped, final, not in mere driblets, as sanity does. And the six months\u2014not three\u2014that I lay in bed taught me a good deal about what is called oneself. \nThomas Caramagno and others, in discussing her illness, warn against the \"neurotic-genius\" way of looking at mental illness, which rationalises the theory that creativity is somehow born of mental illness. Stephen Trombley describes Woolf as having a confrontational relationship with her doctors, and possibly being a woman who is a \"victim of male medicine\", referring to the contemporary relative lack of understanding about mental illness.\nDeath\nAfter completing the manuscript of her last novel (posthumously published), Between the Acts (1941), Woolf fell into a depression similar to that which she had earlier experienced. The onset of World War II, the destruction of her London home during the Blitz, and the cool reception given to her biography of her late friend Roger Fry all worsened her condition until she was unable to work. When Leonard enlisted in the Home Guard, Virginia disapproved. She held fast to her pacifism and criticised her husband for wearing what she considered to be \"the silly uniform of the Home Guard\".After World War II began, Woolf's diary indicates that she was obsessed with death, which figured more and more as her mood darkened. On 28 March 1941, Woolf drowned herself by filling her overcoat pockets with stones and walking into the River Ouse near her home. Her body was not found until 18 April. Her husband buried her cremated remains beneath an elm tree in the garden of Monk's House, their home in Rodmell, Sussex.In her suicide note, addressed to her husband, she wrote:\n\nDearest,\nI feel certain that I am going mad again. I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times. And I shan't recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can't concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I don't think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came. I can't fight it any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I can't even write this properly. I can't read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that\u2014everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can't go on spoiling your life any longer. I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been. V. \nWork\nWoolf is considered to be one of the more important 20th century novelists. A modernist, she was one of the pioneers of using stream of consciousness as a narrative device, alongside contemporaries such as Marcel Proust, Dorothy Richardson and James Joyce. Woolf's reputation was at its greatest during the 1930s, but declined considerably following World War II. The growth of feminist criticism in the 1970s helped re-establish her reputation.Virginia submitted her first article in 1890, to a competition in Tit-Bits. Although it was rejected, this shipboard romance by the 8-year-old would presage her first novel 25 years later, as would contributions to the Hyde Park News, such as the model letter \"to show young people the right way to express what is in their hearts\", a subtle commentary on her mother's legendary matchmaking. She transitioned from juvenilia to professional journalism in 1904 at the age of 22. Violet Dickinson introduced her to Mrs. Lyttelton, the editor of the Women's Supplement of The Guardian, a Church of England newspaper. Invited to submit a 1,500-word article, Virginia sent Lyttelton a review of W.D. Howells' The Son of Royal Langbirth and an essay about her visit to Haworth that year, Haworth, November 1904. The review was published anonymously on 4 December, and the essay on the 21st. In 1905, Woolf began writing for The Times Literary Supplement.Woolf would go on to publish novels and essays as a public intellectual to both critical and popular acclaim. Much of her work was self-published through the Hogarth Press. \"Virginia Woolf's peculiarities as a fiction writer have tended to obscure her central strength: she is arguably the major lyrical novelist in the English language. Her novels are highly experimental: a narrative, frequently uneventful and commonplace, is refracted\u2014and sometimes almost dissolved\u2014in the characters' receptive consciousness. Intense lyricism and stylistic virtuosity fuse to create a world overabundant with auditory and visual impressions\". \"The intensity of Virginia Woolf's poetic vision elevates the ordinary, sometimes banal settings\"\u2014often wartime environments\u2014\"of most of her novels\".\nFiction and drama\nNovels\nHer first novel, The Voyage Out, was published in 1915 at the age of 33, by her half-brother's imprint, Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd. This novel was originally titled Melymbrosia, but Woolf repeatedly changed the draft. An earlier version of The Voyage Out has been reconstructed by Woolf scholar Louise DeSalvo and is now available to the public under the intended title. DeSalvo argues that many of the changes Woolf made in the text were in response to changes in her own life. The novel is set on a ship bound for South America, and a group of young Edwardians onboard and their various mismatched yearnings and misunderstandings. In the novel are hints of themes that would emerge in later work, including the gap between preceding thought and the spoken word that follows, and the lack of concordance between expression and underlying intention, together with how these reveal to us aspects of the nature of love.\n\"Mrs Dalloway (1925) centres on the efforts of Clarissa Dalloway, a middle-aged society woman, to organise a party, even as her life is paralleled with that of Septimus Warren Smith, a working-class veteran who has returned from the First World War bearing deep psychological scars\".\n\"To the Lighthouse (1927) is set on two days ten years apart. The plot centres on the Ramsay family's anticipation of and reflection upon a visit to a lighthouse and the connected familial tensions. One of the primary themes of the novel is the struggle in the creative process that beset painter Lily Briscoe while she struggles to paint in the midst of the family drama. The novel is also a meditation upon the lives of a nation's inhabitants in the midst of war, and of the people left behind.\" It also explores the passage of time, and how women are forced by society to allow men to take emotional strength from them.\nOrlando: A Biography (1928) is one of Virginia Woolf's lightest novels. A parodic biography of a young nobleman who lives for three centuries without ageing much past thirty (but who does abruptly turn into a woman), the book is in part a portrait of Woolf's lover Vita Sackville-West. It was meant to console Vita for the loss of her ancestral home, Knole House, though it is also a satirical treatment of Vita and her work. In Orlando, the techniques of historical biographers are being ridiculed; the character of a pompous biographer is being assumed for it to be mocked.\n\"The Waves (1931) presents a group of six friends whose reflections, which are closer to recitatives than to interior monologues proper, create a wave-like atmosphere that is more akin to a prose poem than to a plot-centred novel\".\nFlush: A Biography (1933) is a part-fiction, part-biography of the cocker spaniel owned by Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The book is written from the dog's point of view. Woolf was inspired to write this book from the success of the Rudolf Besier play The Barretts of Wimpole Street. In the play, Flush is on stage for much of the action. The play was produced for the first time in 1932 by the actress Katharine Cornell.\n\nThe Years (1936), traces the history of the genteel Pargiter family from the 1880s to the \"present day\" of the mid-1930s. The novel had its origin in a lecture Woolf gave to the National Society for Women's Service in 1931, an edited version of which would later be published as \"Professions for Women\". Woolf first thought of making this lecture the basis of a new book-length essay on women, this time taking a broader view of their economic and social life, rather than focusing on women as artists, as the first book had. She soon jettisoned the theoretical framework of her \"novel-essay\" and began to rework the book solely as a fictional narrative, but some of the non-fiction material she first intended for this book was later used in Three Guineas (1938).\n\n\"Her last work, Between the Acts (1941), sums up and magnifies Woolf's chief preoccupations: the transformation of life through art, sexual ambivalence, and meditation on the themes of flux of time and life, presented simultaneously as corrosion and rejuvenation\u2014all set in a highly imaginative and symbolic narrative encompassing almost all of English history.\" This book is the most lyrical of all her works, not only in feeling but in style, being chiefly written in verse. While Woolf's work can be understood as consistently in dialogue with the Bloomsbury Group, particularly its tendency (informed by G.E. Moore, among others) towards doctrinaire rationalism, it is not a simple recapitulation of the coterie's ideals.\nThemes\nWoolf's fiction has been studied for its insight into many themes including war, shell shock, witchcraft, and the role of social class in contemporary modern British society. In the postwar Mrs Dalloway (1925), Woolf addresses the moral dilemma of war and its effects and provides an authentic voice for soldiers returning from World War I, suffering from shell shock, in the person of Septimus Smith. In A Room of One's Own (1929) Woolf equates historical accusations of witchcraft with creativity and genius among women \"When, however, one reads of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils...then I think we are on the track of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen\". Throughout her work Woolf tried to evaluate the degree to which her privileged background framed the lens through which she viewed class. She both examined her own position as someone who would be considered an elitist snob, but attacked the class structure of Britain as she found it. In her 1936 essay Am I a Snob?, she examined her values and those of the privileged circle she existed in. She concluded she was, and subsequent critics and supporters have tried to deal with the dilemma of being both elite and a social critic.The sea is a recurring motif in Woolf's work. Noting Woolf's early memory of listening to waves break in Cornwall, Katharine Smyth writes in The Paris Review that \u2018the radiance [of] cresting water would be consecrated again and again in her writing, saturating not only essays, diaries, and letters but also Jacob\u2019s Room, The Waves, and To the Lighthouse.\u2019 Patrizia A. Muscogiuri explains that \u2018seascapes, sailing, diving and the sea itself are aspects of nature and of human beings\u2019 relationship with it which frequently inspired Virginia Woolf's writing.\u2019 This trope is deeply embedded in her texts\u2019 structure and grammar: James Antoniou notes in Sydney Morning Herald how \u2018Woolf made a virtue of the semicolon, the shape and function of which resembles the wave, her most famous motif.\u2019Despite the considerable conceptual difficulties, given Woolf's idiosyncratic use of language, her works have been translated into over 50 languages. Some writers, such as the Belgian Marguerite Yourcenar, had rather tense encounters with her, while others, such as the Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges, produced versions that were highly controversial.\nDrama\nVirginia Woolf researched the life of her great-aunt, the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, publishing her findings in an essay titled \"Pattledom\" (1925), and later in her introduction to her 1926 edition of Cameron's photographs. She had begun work on a play based on an episode in Cameron's life in 1923, but abandoned it. Finally it was performed on 18 January 1935 at the studio of her sister, Vanessa Bell on Fitzroy Street in 1935. Woolf directed it herself, and the cast were mainly members of the Bloomsbury Group, including herself. Freshwater is a short three act comedy satirising the Victorian era, only performed once in Woolf's lifetime. Beneath the comedic elements, there is an exploration of both generational change and artistic freedom. Both Cameron and Woolf fought against the class and gender dynamics of Victorianism and the play shows links to both To the Lighthouse and A Room of One's Own that would follow.\nNon-fiction\nWoolf wrote a body of autobiographical work and more than 500 essays and reviews, some of which, like A Room of One's Own (1929) were of book length. Not all were published in her lifetime. Shortly after her death, Leonard Woolf produced an edited edition of unpublished essays titled The Moment and other Essays, published by the Hogarth Press in 1947. Many of these were originally lectures that she gave, and several more volumes of essays followed, such as The Captain's Death Bed: and other essays (1950).\nA Room of One's Own\nAmong Woolf's non-fiction works, one of the best known is A Room of One's Own (1929), a book-length essay. Considered a key work of feminist literary criticism, it was written following two lectures she delivered on \"Women and Fiction\" at Cambridge University the previous year. In it, she examines the historical disempowerment women have faced in many spheres, including social, educational and financial. One of her more famous dicta is contained within the book \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\". Much of her argument (\"to show you how I arrived at this opinion about the room and the money\") is developed through the \"unsolved problems\" of women and fiction writing to arrive at her conclusion, although she claimed that was only \"an opinion upon one minor point\". In doing so, she states a good deal about the nature of women and fiction, employing a quasi-fictional style as she examines where women writers failed because of lack of resources and opportunities, examining along the way the experiences of the Bront\u00ebs, George Eliot and George Sand, as well as the fictional character of Shakespeare's sister, equipped with the same genius but not position. She contrasted these women who accepted a deferential status with Jane Austen, who wrote entirely as a woman.\nInfluences\nA major influence on Woolf from 1912 onward was Russian literature as Woolf adopted many of its aesthetic conventions. The style of Fyodor Dostoyevsky with his depiction of a fluid mind in operation helped to influence Woolf's writings about a \"discontinuous writing process\", though Woolf objected to Dostoyevsky's obsession with \"psychological extremity\" and the \"tumultuous flux of emotions\" in his characters together with his right-wing, monarchist politics as Dostoyevsky was an ardent supporter of the autocracy of the Russian Empire. In contrast to her objections to Dostoyevsky's \"exaggerated emotional pitch\", Woolf found much to admire in the work of Anton Chekhov and Leo Tolstoy. Woolf admired Chekhov for his stories of ordinary people living their lives, doing banal things and plots that had no neat endings. From Tolstoy, Woolf drew lessons about how a novelist should depict a character's psychological state and the interior tension within. From Ivan Turgenev, Woolf drew the lessons that there are multiple \"I's\" when writing a novel, and the novelist needed to balance those multiple versions of him- or herself to balance the \"mundane facts\" of a story vs. the writer's overreaching vision, which required a \"total passion\" for art.Another influence on Woolf was the American writer Henry David Thoreau, with Woolf writing in a 1917 essay that her aim as a writer was to follow Thoreau by capturing \"the moment, to burn always with this hard, gem-like flame\" while praising Thoreau for his statement \"The millions are awake enough for physical labor, but only one in hundreds of millions is awake enough to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive\". Woolf praised Thoreau for his \"simplicity\" in finding \"a way for setting free the delicate and complicated machinery of the soul\". Like Thoreau, Woolf believed that it was silence that set the mind free to really contemplate and understand the world. Both authors believed in a certain transcendental, mystical approach to life and writing, where even banal things could be capable of generating deep emotions if one had enough silence and the presence of mind to appreciate them. Woolf and Thoreau were both concerned with the difficulty of human relationships in the modern age. Other notable influences include William Shakespeare, George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, Marcel Proust, Anton Chekhov, Emily Bront\u00eb, Daniel Defoe, James Joyce, and E.M. Forster.\n\nList of selected publications\n\u00a0\u00a0see Kirkpatrick & Clarke (1997), VWS (2018), Carter (2002)\n\nViews\nIn her lifetime, Woolf was outspoken on many topics that were considered controversial, some of which are now considered progressive, others regressive. She was an ardent feminist at a time when women's rights were barely recognised, and anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist and a pacifist when chauvinism was popular. On the other hand, she has been criticised for views on class and race in her private writings and published works. Like many of her contemporaries, some of her writing is now considered offensive. As a result, she is considered polarising, a revolutionary feminist and socialist hero or a purveyor of hate speech.Works such as A Room of One's Own (1929) and Three Guineas (1938) are frequently taught as icons of feminist literature in courses that would be very critical of some of her views expressed elsewhere. She has also been the recipient of considerable homophobic and misogynist criticism.\nHumanist views\nVirginia Woolf was born into a non-religious family and is regarded, along with her fellow Bloomsberries E.M. Forster and G.E. Moore, as a humanist. Both her parents were prominent agnostic atheists. Her father, Leslie Stephen, had become famous in polite society for his writings which expressed and publicised reasons to doubt the veracity of religion. Stephen was also President of the West London Ethical Society, an early humanist organisation, and helped to found the Union of Ethical Societies in 1896. Woolf's mother, Julia Stephen, wrote the book Agnostic Women (1880), which argued that agnosticism (defined here as something more like atheism) could be a highly moral approach to life.\nWoolf was a critic of Christianity. In a letter to Ethel Smyth, she gave a scathing denunciation of the religion, seeing it as self-righteous \"egotism\" and stating \"my Jew [Leonard] has more religion in one toenail\u2014more human love, in one hair\". Woolf stated in her private letters that she thought of herself as an atheist.\nShe thought there were no Gods; no one was to blame; and so she evolved this atheist's religion of doing good for the sake of goodness.\nControversies\nHermione Lee cites a number of extracts from Woolf's writings that many, including Lee, would consider offensive, and these criticisms can be traced back as far as those of Wyndham Lewis and Q.D. Leavis in the 1920s and 1930s. Other authors provide more nuanced contextual interpretations, and stress the complexity of her character and the apparent inherent contradictions in analysing her apparent flaws. She could certainly be off-hand, rude and even cruel in her dealings with other authors, translators and biographers, such as her treatment of Ruth Gruber. Some authors, particularly postcolonial feminists dismiss her (and modernist authors in general) as privileged, elitist, classist, racist, and antisemitic.\nWoolf's tendentious expressions, including prejudicial feelings against disabled people, have often been the topic of academic criticism:\n The first quotation is from a diary entry of September 1920 and runs: \"The fact is the lower classes are detestable.\" The remainder follow the first in reproducing stereotypes standard to upper-class and upper-middle class life in the early 20h century: \"imbeciles should certainly be killed\"; \"Jews\" are greasy; a \"crowd\" is both an ontological \"mass\" and is, again, \"detestable\"; \"Germans\" are akin to vermin; some \"baboon faced intellectuals\" mix with \"sad green dressed negroes and negresses, looking like chimpanzees\" at a peace conference; Kensington High St. revolts one's stomach with its innumerable \"women of incredible mediocrity, drab as dishwater\".\nAntisemitism\nThough accused of antisemitism, the treatment of Judaism and Jews by Woolf is far from straightforward. She was happily married to a Jewish man but often wrote about Jewish characters using stereotypes and generalisations. For instance, she described some of the Jewish characters in her work in terms that suggested they were physically repulsive or dirty. On the other hand, she could criticise her own views: \"How I hated marrying a Jew \u2014 how I hated their nasal voices and their oriental jewellery, and their noses and their wattles \u2014 what a snob I was: for they have immense vitality, and I think I like that quality best of all\" (Letter to Ethel Smyth 1930). These attitudes have been construed to reflect, not so much antisemitism, but tribalism; she married outside her social grouping, and Leonard Woolf, too, expressed misgivings about marrying a gentile. Leonard, \"a penniless Jew from Putney\", lacked the material status of the Stephens and their circle.While travelling on a cruise to Portugal, she protested at finding \"a great many Portuguese Jews on board, and other repulsive objects, but we keep clear of them\". Furthermore, she wrote in her diary: \"I do not like the Jewish voice; I do not like the Jewish laugh.\" Her 1938 short story The Duchess and the Jeweller (originally titled The Duchess and the Jew) has been considered antisemitic.Yet Woolf and her husband Leonard came to despise and fear the 1930s fascism and antisemitism. Her 1938 book Three Guineas was an indictment of fascism and what Woolf described as a recurring propensity among patriarchal societies to enforce repressive societal mores by violence.\nModern scholarship and interpretations\nThough at least one biography of Virginia Woolf appeared in her lifetime, the first authoritative study of her life was published in 1972 by her nephew Quentin Bell. Hermione Lee's 1996 biography Virginia Woolf provides a thorough and authoritative examination of Woolf's life and work, which she discussed in an interview in 1997. In 2001, Louise DeSalvo and Mitchell A. Leaska edited The Letters of Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf. Julia Briggs's Virginia Woolf: An Inner Life (2005) focuses on Woolf's writing, including her novels and her commentary on the creative process, to illuminate her life. The sociologist Pierre Bourdieu also uses Woolf's literature to understand and analyse gender domination. Woolf biographer Gillian Gill notes that Woolf's traumatic experience of sexual abuse by her half-brothers during her childhood influenced her advocacy of protection of vulnerable children from similar experiences.\nVirginia Woolf and her mother\nThe intense scrutiny of Virginia Woolf's literary output (see Bibliography) has led to speculation as to her mother's influence, including psychoanalytic studies of mother and daughter. Woolf states that, \"my first memory, and in fact it is the most important of all my memories\" is of her mother. Her memories of her mother are memories of an obsession, starting with her first major breakdown on her mother's death in 1895, the loss having a profound lifelong effect. In many ways, her mother's profound influence on Virginia Woolf is conveyed in the latter's recollections, \"there she is; beautiful, emphatic ... closer than any of the living are, lighting our random lives as with a burning torch, infinitely noble and delightful to her children\".Woolf described her mother as an \"invisible presence\" in her life, and Ellen Rosenman argues that the mother-daughter relationship is a constant in Woolf's writing. She describes how Woolf's modernism needs to be viewed in relationship to her ambivalence towards her Victorian mother, the centre of the former's female identity, and her voyage to her own sense of autonomy. To Woolf, \"Saint Julia\" was both a martyr whose perfectionism was intimidating and a source of deprivation, by her absences real and virtual and premature death. Julia's influence and memory pervades Woolf's life and work. \"She has haunted me\", she wrote.\nHistorical feminism\nAccording to the 2007 book Feminism: From Mary Wollstonecraft to Betty Friedan by Bhaskar A. Shukla, \"Recently, studies of Virginia Woolf have focused on feminist and lesbian themes in her work, such as in the 1997 collection of critical essays, Virginia Woolf: Lesbian Readings, edited by Eileen Barrett and Patricia Cramer.\" In 1928, Woolf took a grassroots approach to informing and inspiring feminism. She addressed undergraduate women at the ODTAA Society at Girton College, Cambridge and the Arts Society at Newnham College with two papers that eventually became A Room of One's Own (1929).Woolf's best-known nonfiction works, A Room of One's Own (1929) and Three Guineas (1938), examine the difficulties that female writers and intellectuals faced because men held disproportionate legal and economic power, as well as the future of women in education and society, as the societal effects of industrialisation and birth control had not yet fully been realised. In The Second Sex (1949), Simone de Beauvoir counts, of all women who ever lived, only three female writers\u2014Emily Bront\u00eb, Woolf and \"sometimes\" Katherine Mansfield\u2014 have explored \"the given\".\nIn popular culture\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a 1962 play by Edward Albee. It examines the structure of the marriage of an American middle-aged academic couple, Martha and George. Mike Nichols directed a film version in 1966, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Taylor won the 1966 Academy Award for Best Actress for the role.\nMe! I'm Afraid of Virginia Woolf, a 1978 TV play, references the title of the Edward Albee play and features an English literature teacher who has a poster of her. It was written by Alan Bennett and directed by Stephen Frears.\nThe artwork The Dinner Party (1979) features a place setting for Woolf.\nThe 1996 album Poetic Justice, by British musician Steve Harley, contains a tribute to Woolf, specifically her most adventurous novel, in its closing track: \"Riding the Waves (for Virginia Woolf)\".\nMichael Cunningham's 1998 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Hours focused on three generations of women affected by Woolf's novel Mrs Dalloway. In 2002, a film version of the novel was released, starring Nicole Kidman as Woolf. Kidman won the 2003 Academy Award for her portrayal.\nSusan Sellers's novel Vanessa and Virginia (2008) explores the close sibling relationship between Woolf and her sister, Vanessa Bell. It was adapted for the stage by Elizabeth Wright in 2010 and first performed by Moving Stories Theatre Company.\nPriya Parmar's 2014 novel Vanessa and Her Sister also examined the Stephen sisters' relationship during the early years of their association with what became known as the Bloomsbury Group.\nAn exhibition on Virginia Woolf was held at the National Portrait Gallery from July to October 2014.\nIn the 2014 novel The House at the End of Hope Street, Woolf is featured as one of the women who has lived in the titular house.\nVirginia is portrayed by both Lydia Leonard and Catherine McCormack in the BBC's three-part drama series Life in Squares (2015).\nOn 25 January 2018, Google showed a Google doodle celebrating her 136th birthday.\nIn many Barnes & Noble stores, Woolf is featured in Gary Kelly's Author Mural Panels, an imprint of the Barnes & Noble Author brand that also features other notable authors like Hurston, Tagore, and Kafka.\nThe 2018 film Vita and Virginia depicts the relationship between Vita Sackville-West and Woolf, portrayed by Gemma Arterton and Elizabeth Debicki respectively.Adaptations\nA number of Virginia Woolf's works have been adapted for the screen, and her play Freshwater (1935) is the basis for a 1994 chamber opera, Freshwater, by Andy Vores. The final segment of the 2018 London Unplugged is adapted from her short story Kew Gardens. Septimus and Clarissa, a stage adaptation of Mrs. Dalloway was created and produced by the New York-based ensemble Ripe Time in 2011 at the Baruch Performing Arts Center. It was adapted by Ellen McLaughlin, and directed and devised by Rachel Dickstein. It was nominated for a 2012 Drama League award for Outstanding Production, a Drama Desk nomination for Outstanding Score (Gina Leishman) and a Joe A. Calloway Award nomination for outstanding direction (Rachel Dickstein.)\n\nLegacy\n\nVirginia Woolf is known for her contributions to 20th-century literature and her essays, as well as the influence she has had on literary, particularly feminist criticism. A number of authors have stated that their work was influenced by her, including Margaret Atwood, Michael Cunningham, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, and Toni Morrison. Her iconic image is instantly recognisable from the Beresford portrait of her at twenty (at the top of this page) to the Beck and Macgregor portrait in her mother's dress in Vogue at 44 (see image) or Man Ray's cover of Time magazine (see image) at 55. More postcards of Woolf are sold by the National Portrait Gallery, London than any other person. Her image is ubiquitous, and can be found on products ranging from tea towels to T-shirts.Virginia Woolf is studied around the world, with organisations such as the Virginia Woolf Society, and The Virginia Woolf Society of Japan. In addition, trusts\u2014such as the Asham Trust\u2014encourage writers in her honour. Although she had no descendants, a number of her extended family are notable.\nMonuments and memorials\nIn 2013, Woolf was honoured by her alma mater of King's College London with the opening of the Virginia Woolf Building on Kingsway, with a plaque commemorating her time there and her contributions (see image), together with this exhibit depicting her accompanied by a quotation \"London itself perpetually attracts, stimulates, gives me a play & a story & a poem\" from her 1926 diary. Busts of Virginia Woolf have been erected at her home in Rodmell, Sussex and at Tavistock Square, London where she lived between 1924 and 1939.\nIn 2014, she was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco's Castro neighbourhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields\".Woolf Works, a women's co-working space in Singapore, opened in 2014 and was named after her in tribute to the essay A Room of One's Own; it also has many other things named after it (see the essay's article).\nA campaign was launched in 2018 by Aurora Metro Arts and Media to erect a statue of Woolf in Richmond, where she lived for 10 years. The proposed statue shows her reclining on a bench overlooking the river Thames.\nFamily trees\n\u00a0see Lee 1999, pp.\u00a0xviii\u2013xvix, Bell 1972, pp.\u00a0x\u2013xi, Bicknell 1996a, p.\u00a0xx, Venn 1904\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nBibliography notes\n\nBibliography references\n\nExternal links\nWorks by or about Virginia Woolf at Internet Archive\nWorks by Virginia Woolf at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \nVirginia Woolf Papers at the Mortimer Rare Book Collection, Smith College Special Collections\nThe Virginia Woolf Blog\n\n","99":"\n\nJames Augustine Aloysius Joyce (2 February 1882 \u2013 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist, short story writer, poet, teacher, and literary critic. He contributed to the modernist avant-garde movement and is regarded as one of the most influential and important writers of the 20th century. Joyce is best known for Ulysses (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer's Odyssey are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, most famously stream of consciousness. Other well-known works are the short-story collection Dubliners (1914), and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, his published letters and occasional journalism.\nJoyce was born in Dublin into a middle-class family. A brilliant student, he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run O'Connell School before excelling at the Jesuit schools Clongowes and Belvedere, despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father's unpredictable finances. He went on to attend University College Dublin.\nIn 1904, in his early 20s, Joyce emigrated to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife) Nora Barnacle. They lived in Trieste, Paris, and Z\u00fcrich. Although most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe centres on Dublin and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies, and friends from his time there. Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of Ulysses, he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, \"For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.\"\nEarly life\nOn 2 February 1882, Joyce was born at 41 Brighton Square, Rathgar, Dublin, Ireland. Joyce's father was John Stanislaus Joyce and his mother was Mary Jane \"May\" (n\u00e9e Murray). He was the eldest of 10 surviving siblings; two died of typhoid. James was baptised according to the rites of the Catholic Church in the nearby St Joseph's Church in Terenure on 5 February 1882 by Rev. John O'Mulloy. Joyce's godparents were Philip and Ellen McCann.\nJohn Stanislaus Joyce's family came from Fermoy in County Cork; they had owned a small salt and lime works. Joyce's paternal grandfather, James Augustine Joyce, married Ellen O'Connell, daughter of John O'Connell, a Cork alderman who owned a drapery business and other properties in Cork City. Ellen's family claimed kinship with Daniel O'Connell, \"The Liberator\". The Joyce family's purported ancestor, Se\u00e1n M\u00f3r Seoighe (fl. 1680) was a stonemason from Connemara.\nIn 1887, his father was appointed rate collector by Dublin Corporation; the family subsequently moved to the fashionable adjacent small town of Bray, 12 miles (19\u00a0km) from Dublin. Around this time, Joyce was attacked by a dog, leading to his lifelong cynophobia. He suffered from astraphobia; a superstitious aunt had described thunderstorms as a sign of God's wrath.In 1891, Joyce wrote a poem on the death of Charles Stewart Parnell. His father was angry at the treatment of Parnell by the Catholic Church, the Irish Home Rule Party, and the British Liberal Party and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership, but the Vatican's role in allying with the British Conservative Party to prevent home rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce. The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the Vatican Library. In November, John Joyce was entered in Stubbs' Gazette (a publisher of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family's slide into poverty caused mainly by his drinking and financial mismanagement.Joyce had begun his education at Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit boarding school near Clane, County Kildare, in 1888, but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian Brothers O'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered a place in the Jesuits' Dublin school, Belvedere College, in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest called John Conmee, who knew the family, and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the Sodality of Our Lady by his peers at Belvedere. The philosophy of Thomas Aquinas continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.\nEducation\nJoyce enrolled at the recently established University College Dublin (UCD) in 1898, studying English, French, and Italian. He became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. In 1900, his laudatory review of Henrik Ibsen's When We Dead Awaken was published in The Fortnightly Review; it was his first publication, and after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at UCD appeared as characters in Joyce's works. His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, Tom Kettle, Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, and Oliver St. John Gogarty. Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by Arthur Griffith in his newspaper, United Irishman, in November 1901. Joyce had written an article on the Irish Literary Theatre, and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce. In 1901, the National Census of Ireland lists James Joyce (19) as an English- and Irish-speaking scholar living with his mother and father, six sisters, and three brothers at Royal Terrace (now Inverness Road), Clontarf, Dublin.After graduating from UCD in 1902, Joyce left for Paris to study medicine, but he soon abandoned this. Joyce\u2019s biographer, Richard Ellmann, suggests that this may have been because he found the technical lectures in French too difficult. Joyce had already failed to pass chemistry in English in Dublin, claiming ill health as the problem and wrote home that he was unwell and complained about the cold weather. He stayed on for a few months, appealing for money his family could ill-afford and reading late in the Biblioth\u00e8que Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve. When his mother was diagnosed with cancer, his father sent a telegram that read, \"NOTHER  [sic] DYING COME HOME FATHER\". Joyce returned to Ireland. Fearing for her son's impiety, his mother tried unsuccessfully to get Joyce to make his confession and to take communion. She finally passed into a coma and died on 13 August, James and his brother Stanislaus having refused to kneel with other members of the family praying at her bedside. After her death, he continued to drink heavily, and conditions at home grew quite appalling. He scraped together a living reviewing books, teaching, and singing; he was an accomplished tenor, and won the bronze medal in the 1904 Feis Ceoil.\nCareer\nOn 7 January 1904, Joyce attempted to publish A Portrait of the Artist, an essay-story dealing with aesthetics, only to have it rejected by the free-thinking magazine Dana. He decided, on his 22nd birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called Stephen Hero. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The unfinished Stephen Hero was published after his death.Also in 1904, he met Nora Barnacle, a young woman from Galway city, who was working as a chambermaid. On 16 June 1904, they had their first outing together, walking to the Dublin suburb of Ringsend, where Nora masturbated him. This event was commemorated by providing the date for the action of Ulysses (as \"Bloomsday\").Joyce remained in Dublin for some time longer, drinking heavily. After one of his drinking binges, he got into a fight over a misunderstanding with a man in St Stephen's Green; he was picked up and dusted off by a minor acquaintance of his father's, Alfred H. Hunter, who took him into his home to tend to his injuries. Hunter was rumoured to be a Jew and to have an unfaithful wife, and would serve as one of the models for Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of Ulysses. He took up with the medical student Oliver St. John Gogarty, who informed the character for Buck Mulligan in Ulysses. After six nights in the Martello Tower that Gogarty was renting in Sandycove, he left in the middle of the night following an altercation that involved another student he lived with, the unstable Dermot Chenevix Trench (Haines in Ulysses), who fired a pistol at some pans hanging directly over Joyce's bed. Joyce walked the 8 miles (13\u00a0km) back to Dublin to stay with relatives for the night, and sent a friend to the tower the next day to pack his trunk. Shortly after, the couple left Ireland to live on the continent.\n\n1904\u201320: Trieste and Z\u00fcrich\nJoyce and Nora went into self-imposed exile, moving first to Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, where he ostensibly taught English at the Berlitz Language School through an agent in England. It later became evident that the agent had been swindled; the director of the school sent Joyce on to Trieste, which was then part of Austria-Hungary (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found no position was available for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in Pola, then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of Croatia). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians\u2014having discovered an espionage ring in the city\u2014expelled all aliens. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there. He remained in Trieste for most of the next 10 years.Later that year, Nora gave birth to their first child, George (known as Giorgio). Joyce persuaded his brother, Stanislaus, to join him in Trieste, and secured a teaching position for him at the school. Joyce sought to augment his family's meagre income with his brother's earnings. Stanislaus and Joyce had strained relations while they lived together in Trieste, arguing about Joyce's drinking habits and frivolity with money.Joyce became frustrated with life in Trieste, and moved to Rome in late 1906, taking employment as a clerk in a bank. He disliked Rome and returned to Trieste in early 1907. His daughter Lucia was born later that year.Joyce returned to Dublin in mid-1909 with George, to visit his father and work on getting Dubliners published. He visited Nora's family in Galway and liked Nora's mother very much. While preparing to return to Trieste, he decided to take one of his sisters, Eva, back with him to help Nora run the home. He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing, he launched Ireland's first cinema, the Volta Cinematograph, which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow. Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent the rest of her life on the continent, eventually marrying a Czech bank cashier, Frantisek Schaurek.Joyce returned to Dublin again briefly in mid-1912 during his years-long fight with Dublin publisher George Roberts over the publication of Dubliners. His trip was once again fruitless, and on his return, he wrote the poem \"Gas from a Burner\", an invective against Roberts. After this trip, he never again came closer to Dublin than London, despite many pleas from his father and invitations from his fellow Irish writer William Butler Yeats.\nOne of his students in Trieste was Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym Italo Svevo. They met in 1907, and became lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin and became a primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about the Jewish faith in Ulysses came from Schmitz's responses to queries from Joyce. While living in Trieste, Joyce was first beset with eye problems that ultimately required over a dozen surgical operations.Joyce concocted a number of money-making schemes during this period, including an attempt to become a cinema magnate in Dublin. He frequently discussed, but ultimately abandoned, a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste. Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were for a long time displayed in the windows of their premises in Dublin. Joyce's skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence. What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students.\nIn 1915, after most of his students in Trieste were conscripted to fight in the Great War, Joyce moved to Z\u00fcrich. Two influential private students, Baron Ambrogio Ralli and Count Francesco Sordina, petitioned officials for an exit permit for the Joyces, who in turn agreed not to take any action against the emperor of Austria-Hungary during the war.During this period, Joyce took an active interest in socialism. He had attended socialist meetings when he was still in Dublin, and 1905, while in Trieste, he described his politics as \"those of a socialist artist.\" Although his practical engagement waned after 1907 due to the \"endless internecine warfare\" he observed in socialist organizations, many Joyce scholars such as Richard Ellmann, Dominic Manganiello, Robert Scholes, and George J. Watson agree that Joyce's interest in socialism and pacifistic anarchism continued for much of his life, and that both the form and content of Joyce's work reflect a sympathy for democratic and socialist ideas. In 1918, he declared himself \"against every state\" and found much succor in the individualist philosophies of Benjamin Tucker and Oscar Wilde's The Soul of Man Under Socialism. Later in the 1930s, Joyce rated his experiences with the defeated multi-ethnic Habsburg Empire as: \"They called the Empire a ramshackle empire, I wish to God there were more such empires.\"\n1920\u201341: Paris and Z\u00fcrich\nJoyce set himself to finishing Ulysses in Paris, delighted to find that he was gradually gaining fame as an avant-garde writer. A further grant from Harriet Shaw Weaver meant he could devote himself full-time to writing again, as well as consort with other literary figures in the city. During this time, Joyce's eyes began to give him more and more problems, and he often wore an eyepatch. He was treated by Louis Borsch in Paris, undergoing nine operations before Borsch's death in 1929. Throughout the 1930s, he travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye surgeries and for treatments for his daughter Lucia, who according to the Joyces, suffered from schizophrenia. Lucia was analysed by Carl Jung at the time, who after reading Ulysses is said to have concluded that her father had schizophrenia. Jung said that she and her father were two people heading to the bottom of a river, except that Joyce was diving and Lucia was sinking.In Paris, Maria and Eugene Jolas nursed Joyce during his long years of writing Finnegans Wake. Were it not for their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's constant financial support),  a good possibility existed  that his books might never have been finished or published. In their literary magazine Transition, the Jolases published serially various sections of Finnegans Wake under the title Work in Progress. Joyce returned to Z\u00fcrich in late 1940, fleeing the Nazi occupation of France. Joyce used his contacts to help some 16 Jews escape Nazi persecution.\nJoyce and religion\nThe issue of Joyce's relationship with religion is somewhat controversial. Early in life, he lapsed from Catholicism, according to first-hand testimonies coming from himself, his brother Stanislaus Joyce, and his wife:\n\nMy mind rejects the whole present social order and Christianity\u2014home, the recognised virtues, classes of life and religious doctrines. ... Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it impossible for me to remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar, but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.\nWhen the arrangements for Joyce's burial were being made, a Catholic priest offered a religious service, which Joyce's wife, Nora, declined, saying, \"I couldn't do that to him.\"Leonard Strong, William T. Noon, Robert Boyle, and others have argued that Joyce, later in life, reconciled with the faith he rejected earlier in life, and that his parting with the faith was succeeded by a not so obvious reunion, and that Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are essentially Catholic expressions. Likewise, Hugh Kenner and T. S. Eliot believed they saw between the lines of Joyce's work the outlook of a serious Christian and that beneath the veneer of the work lies a remnant of Catholic belief and attitude. Kevin Sullivan maintains that, rather than reconciling with the faith, Joyce never left it. Critics holding this view insist that Stephen, the protagonist of the semi-autobiographical A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as well as Ulysses, is not Joyce. Somewhat cryptically, in an interview after completing Ulysses, in response to the question \"When did you leave the Catholic Church\", Joyce answered, \"That's for the Church to say.\" Eamonn Hughes maintains that Joyce takes a dialectic approach, both affirming and denying, saying that Stephen's much noted non-serviam is qualified\u2014\"I will not serve that which I no longer believe...\", and that the non-serviam will always be balanced by Stephen's \"I am a servant...\" and Molly's \"yes\". He attended Catholic Mass and Orthodox Divine Liturgy, especially during Holy Week, purportedly for aesthetic reasons. His sisters noted his Holy Week attendance and that he did not seek to dissuade them. One friend reported that Joyce cried \"secret tears\" upon hearing Jesus' words on the cross and another suggested that he was a \"believer at heart\" because of his frequent attendance at church.Umberto Eco compares Joyce to the ancient episcopi vagantes (wandering bishops) in the Middle Ages. They left a discipline, not a cultural heritage or a way of thinking. Like them, the writer retains the sense of blasphemy held as a liturgical ritual.Some critics and biographers have opined along the lines of Andrew Gibson: \"The modern James Joyce may have vigorously resisted the oppressive power of Catholic tradition. But there was another Joyce who asserted his allegiance to that tradition, and never left it, or wanted to leave it, behind him.\" Gibson argues that Joyce \"remained a Catholic intellectual if not a believer\" since his thinking remained influenced by his cultural background, even though he lived apart from that culture. His relationship with religion was complex and not easily understood, even perhaps by himself. He acknowledged the debt he owed to his early Jesuit training. Joyce told the sculptor August Suter, that from his Jesuit education, he had 'learnt to arrange things in such a way that they become easy to survey and to judge.'\nDeath\nOn 11 January 1941, Joyce underwent surgery in Z\u00fcrich for a perforated duodenal ulcer. He fell into a coma the following day. He awoke at 2\u00a0am on 13 January 1941, and asked a nurse to call his wife and son, before losing consciousness again. They were en route when he died 15\u00a0minutes later. Joyce was less than a month short of his 59th birthday.His body was buried in the Fluntern Cemetery, Z\u00fcrich.  Swiss tenor Max Meili sang \"Addio terra, addio cielo\" from Monteverdi's L'Orfeo at the burial service. Although two senior Irish diplomats were in Switzerland at the time, neither attended Joyce's funeral, and the Irish government later declined Nora's offer to permit the repatriation of Joyce's remains. When Joseph Walshe, secretary at the Department of External Affairs in Dublin, was informed of Joyce's death by Frank Cremins, charg\u00e9 d'affaires at Bern, Walshe responded \"Please wire details of Joyce's death. If possible find out did he die a Catholic? Express sympathy with Mrs Joyce and explain inability to attend funeral\". Buried originally in an ordinary grave, Joyce was moved in 1966 to a more prominent \"honour grave\", with a seated portrait statue by American artist Milton Hebald nearby. Nora, whom he had married in 1931, survived him by 10 years. She is buried by his side, as is their son Giorgio, who died in 1976.In October 2019, a motion was put to Dublin City Council to plan and budget for the costs of the exhumations and reburials of Joyce and his family somewhere in Dublin, subject to his family's wishes. The proposal immediately became controversial, with the Irish Times commenting: \"...it is hard not to suspect that there is a calculating, even mercantile, aspect to contemporary Ireland's relationship to its great writers, whom we are often more keen to 'celebrate', and if possible monetise, than read\".\nMajor works\nDubliners\nDubliners is a collection of 15 short stories by Joyce, first published in 1914. They form a naturalistic depiction of Irish middle-class life in and around Dublin in the early years of the 20th century.\nThe stories were written when Irish nationalism was at its peak, and a search for a national identity and purpose was raging; at a crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by converging ideas and influences. The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel Ulysses. The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence, and maturity.\n\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, published in 1916, is a nearly complete rewrite of the abandoned novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript in a fit of rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A K\u00fcnstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of the protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.\nExiles and poetry\nDespite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, Exiles, begun shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband-and-wife relationship, the play looks back to The Dead (the final story in Dubliners) and forward to Ulysses, which Joyce began around the time of the play's composition.\nJoyce published a number of books of poetry. His first mature published work was the satirical broadside \"The Holy Office\" (1904), in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the Celtic Revival. His first full-length poetry collection, Chamber Music (1907; referring, Joyce joked, to the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot), consisted of 36 short lyrics. This publication led to his inclusion in the Imagist Anthology, edited by Ezra Pound, who was a champion of Joyce's work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime include \"Gas from a Burner\" (1912), Pomes Penyeach (1927), and \"Ecce Puer\" (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father). It was published by the Black Sun Press in Collected Poems (1936).\n\nUlysses\nAs he was completing work on Dubliners in 1906, Joyce considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called Leopold Bloom under the title Ulysses. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).\nThanks to Ezra Pound, serial publication of the novel in the magazine The Little Review began in March 1918. This magazine was edited by Margaret C. Anderson and Jane Heap, with the intermittent financial backing of John Quinn, a successful New York commercial lawyer with an interest in contemporary experimental art and literature.\nThis provoked the first accusations of obscenity with which the book would be identified for so long. Its amorphous structure with frank, intimate musings (stream of consciousness) were seen to offend both church and state. The publication encountered problems with New York Postal Authorities; serialisation ground to a halt in December 1920; the editors were convicted of publishing obscenity in February 1921. Although the conviction was based on the \"Nausica\u00e4\" episode of Ulysses, The Little Review had fuelled the fires of controversy with dada poet Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven's defence of Ulysses in an essay \"The Modest Woman\". Joyce's novel was not published in the United States until 1934.Partly because of this controversy, Joyce found  getting a publisher to accept the book to be difficult, but it was published in 1922 by Sylvia Beach from her well-known Rive Gauche bookshop, Shakespeare and Company. An English edition published the same year by Joyce's patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed. The following year, John Rodker produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at Folkestone. A further consequence of the novel's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that \"bootleg\" versions appeared, including pirate versions from publisher Samuel Roth. In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication.\nWith the appearance of Ulysses, and T.S. Eliot's poem, The Waste Land, 1922 was a key year in the history of English-language literary modernism. In Ulysses, Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and almost every other literary technique to present his characters. The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the Odyssey of Homer in modern Dublin, and represents Odysseus (Ulysses), Penelope, and Telemachus in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly Bloom, and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe, it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model. To achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of Thom's Directory\u2014a work that listed the owners and\/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.\nThe book consists of 18 chapters, each covering roughly one hour of the day, beginning around about 8\u00a0am and ending sometime after 2\u00a0am the following morning. Each of the 18 chapters of the novel employs its own literary style. Each chapter also refers to a specific episode in Homer's Odyssey and has a specific colour, art, or science and bodily organ associated with it. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal, schematic structure represents one of the book's major contributions to the development of 20th-century modernist literature. Other contributions include the use of classical mythology as a framework for his book and the near-obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters. Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, \"I may have oversystematised Ulysses,\" and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer. Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form. It was only when Stuart Gilbert published his critical work on Ulysses in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert, but as Terrence Killeen points out, this schema was developed after the novel had been written and was not something that Joyce consulted as he wrote the novel.\nFinnegans Wake\nHaving completed work on Ulysses, Joyce was so exhausted that he did not write a line of prose for a year. On 10 March 1923, he informed his patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver: \"Yesterday I wrote two pages\u2014the first I have since the final Yes of Ulysses. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of foolscap so that I could read them. Il lupo perde il pelo ma non il vizio, the Italians say. 'The wolf may lose his skin but not his vice' or 'the leopard cannot change his spots.'\" Thus was born a text that became known, first, as Work in Progress and later Finnegans Wake.\nBy 1926, Joyce had completed the first two parts of the book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas, who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including the death of his father in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.Reaction to the work was mixed, including negative comment from early supporters of Joyce's work, such as Pound and the author's brother, Stanislaus Joyce. To counteract this hostile reception, a book of essays by supporters of the new work, including Beckett, William Carlos Williams, and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress. At his 57th birthday party at the Jolases' home, Joyce revealed the final title of the work and Finnegans Wake was published in book form on 4 May 1939. Later, further negative comments surfaced from doctor and author Hervey Cleckley, who questioned the significance others had placed on the work. In his book The Mask of Sanity, Cleckley refers to Finnegans Wake as \"a 628-page collection of erudite gibberish indistinguishable to most people from the familiar word salad produced by hebephrenic patients on the back wards of any state hospital.\"Joyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions, and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in Finnegans Wake, which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction, and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multilevel puns. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than, that used by Lewis Carroll in Jabberwocky. This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce's oft-quoted description in the Wake of Ulysses as his \"usylessly unreadable Blue Book of Eccles\" to the Wake itself. However, readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot.\nMuch of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns, which draw on a wide range of languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use, and as Joyce's eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author's dictation.The view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by Giambattista Vico, and the metaphysics of Giordano Bruno of Nola are important to the interplay of the \"characters\". Vico propounded a cyclical view of history, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing words of the book. Finnegans Wake opens with the words \"riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs\" (\"vicus\" is a pun on Vico) and ends \"A way a lone a last a loved a long the\". In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle. Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the Wake would suffer from \"ideal insomnia\", and on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.\n\nLegacy\nJoyce's work has been an important influence on writers and scholars such as Samuel Beckett, Se\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in, Jorge Luis Borges, Flann O'Brien, Salman Rushdie, Robert Anton Wilson, John Updike, David Lodge, Cormac McCarthy, and Joseph Campbell. Ulysses has been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire [Modernist] movement\".  The Bulgarian-French literary theorist Julia Kristeva characterised Joyce's novel writing as \"polyphonic\" and a hallmark of postmodernity alongside the poets Mallarm\u00e9 and Rimbaud.\nSome scholars, notably Vladimir Nabokov, have reservations, often championing some of his fiction while condemning other works. In Nabokov's opinion, Ulysses was brilliant, while Finnegans Wake was horrible.Joyce's influence is also evident in fields other than literature. The sentence \"Three quarks for Muster Mark!\" in Joyce's Finnegans Wake is the source of the word \"quark\", the name of one of the elementary particles proposed by physicist Murray Gell-Mann in 1963.The work and life of Joyce is celebrated annually on 16 June, known as Bloomsday, in Dublin and in an increasing number of cities worldwide, and critical studies in scholarly publications, such as the James Joyce Quarterly, continue. Both popular and academic uses of Joyce's work were hampered by restrictions imposed by Stephen J. Joyce, Joyce's grandson, and executor of his literary estate until his 2020 death. On 1 January 2012, those restrictions were lessened by the expiry of copyright protection of much of the published work of James Joyce.In April 2013, the Central Bank of Ireland issued a silver \u20ac10 commemorative coin in honour of Joyce that misquoted a famous line from Ulysses.\nBibliography\nProse\nDubliners (short-story collection, 1914)\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (novel, 1916)\nUlysses (novel, 1922)\nFinnegans Wake (1939, restored 2012)Poetry collections\nChamber Music (poems, Elkin Mathews, 1907)\nGiacomo Joyce (written 1907, published by Faber and Faber, 1968)\nPomes Penyeach (poems, Shakespeare and Company, 1927)\nCollected Poems (poems, Black Sun Press, 1936, which includes Chamber Music, Pomes Penyeach and other previously published works)Play\nExiles (play, 1918)Posthumous publications and drafts\nFiction\n\nStephen Hero (precursor to A Portrait; written 1904\u201306, published 1944)\nThe Cat and the Devil (London: Faber and Faber, 1965)\nThe Cats of Copenhagen (Ithys Press, 2012)\nFinn's Hotel (Ithys Press, 2013)Non-Fiction\n\nThe Critical Writings of James Joyce (Eds.

He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art and edited BLAST, the literary magazine of the Vorticists.His novels include Tarr (1918) and The Human Age trilogy, composed of The Childermass (1928), Monstre Gai (1955) and Malign Fiesta (1955). A fourth volume, titled The Trial of Man, was unfinished at the time of his death. He also wrote two autobiographical volumes: Blasting and Bombardiering (1937) and Rude Assignment: A Narrative of my Career Up-to-Date (1950).\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nLewis was born on 18 November 1882, reputedly on his father's yacht off the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. His English mother, Anne Stuart Lewis (n\u00e9e Prickett), and American father, Charles Edward Lewis, separated about 1893. His mother subsequently returned to England. Lewis was educated in England at Rugby School and then Slade School of Fine Art, University College London. He spent most of the 1900s travelling around Europe and studying art in Paris. While in Paris, he attended lectures by Henri Bergson on process philosophy.\n\nEarly work and development of Vorticism (1908\u20131915)\nIn 1908, Lewis moved to London, where he would reside for much of his life. In 1909, he published his first work, accounts of his travels in Brittany, in Ford Madox Ford's The English Review. He was a founding member of the Camden Town Group, which brought him into close contact with the Bloomsbury Group, particularly Roger Fry and Clive Bell, with whom he soon fell out.\nIn 1912, Lewis exhibited his work at the second Postimpressionist exhibition: Cubo-Futurist illustrations to Timon of Athens and three major oil paintings. In 1912, he was commissioned to produce a decorative mural, a drop curtain, and more designs for The Cave of the Golden Calf, an avant-garde cabaret and nightclub on Heddon Street.From 1913 to 1915, Lewis developed the style of geometric abstraction for which he is best known today, which his friend Ezra Pound dubbed \"Vorticism.\" Lewis sought to combine the strong structure of Cubism, which he found was not \"alive,\" with the liveliness of Futurist art, which lacked structure. The combination was a strikingly dramatic critique of modernity. In his early visual works, Lewis may have been influenced by Bergson's process philosophy. Though he was later savagely critical of Bergson, he admitted in a letter to Theodore Weiss (19 April 1949) that he \"began by embracing his evolutionary system.\" Nietzsche was an equally important influence.\nLewis had a brief tenure at Roger Fry's Omega Workshops, but left after a quarrel with Fry over a commission to provide wall decorations for the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition, which Lewis believed Fry had misappropriated. He and several other Omega artists started a competing workshop called the Rebel Art Centre. The Centre operated for only four months, but it gave birth to the Vorticist group and its publication, BLAST. In BLAST, Lewis formally expounded the Vorticist aesthetic in a manifesto, distinguishing it from other avant-garde practices. He also wrote and published a play, Enemy of the Stars. It is a proto-absurdist, Expressionist drama. Lewis scholar Melania Terrazas identifies it as a precursor to the plays of Samuel Beckett.\nWorld War I (1915\u20131918)\nIn 1915, the Vorticists held their only U.K. exhibition before the movement broke up, largely as a result of World War I. Lewis himself was posted to the western front and served as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. Much of his time was spent in Forward Observation Posts looking down at apparently deserted German lines, registering targets and calling down fire from batteries massed around the rim of the Ypres Salient. He made vivid accounts of narrow misses and deadly artillery duels.After the Third Battle of Ypres, Lewis was appointed as an official war artist for both the Canadian and British governments. For the Canadians, he painted A Canadian Gun-pit (1918) from sketches made on Vimy Ridge. For the British, he painted one of his best-known works, A Battery Shelled (1919), drawing on his own experience at Ypres. Lewis exhibited his war drawings and some other paintings of the war in an exhibition, \"Guns\", in 1918.\nAlthough the Vorticist group broke up after the war, Lewis's patron, John Quinn, organized a Vorticist exhibition at the Penguin Club in New York in 1917. His first novel, Tarr, was serialized in The Egoist during 1916\u201317 and published in book form in 1918. It is widely regarded as one of the key modernist texts.Lewis later documented his experiences and opinions of this period of his life in the autobiographical Blasting and Bombardiering (1937), which covered his life up to 1926.\n\nTyros and writing (1918\u20131929)\nAfter the war, Lewis resumed his career as a painter with a major exhibition, Tyros and Portraits, at the Leicester Galleries in 1921. \"Tyros\" were satirical caricatures intended to comment on the culture of the \"new epoch\" that succeeded the First World War. A Reading of Ovid and Mr Wyndham Lewis as a Tyro are the only surviving oil paintings from this series. Lewis also launched his second magazine, The Tyro, of which there were only two issues. The second (1922) contained an important statement of Lewis's visual aesthetic: \"Essay on the Objective of Plastic Art in our Time\". It was during the early 1920s that he perfected his incisive draughtsmanship.\nBy the late 1920s, he concentrated on writing. He launched yet another magazine, The Enemy (1927\u20131929), largely written by himself and declaring its belligerent critical stance in its title. The magazine and other theoretical and critical works he published from 1926 to 1929 mark a deliberate separation from the avant-garde and his previous associates. He believed that their work failed to show sufficient critical awareness of those ideologies that worked against truly revolutionary change in the West, and therefore became a vehicle for these pernicious ideologies. His major theoretical and cultural statement from this period is The Art of Being Ruled (1926).\nTime and Western Man (1927) is a cultural and philosophical discussion that includes penetrating critiques of James Joyce, Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound that are still read. Lewis also attacked the process philosophy of Bergson, Samuel Alexander, Alfred North Whitehead, and others.\nFiction and political writing (1930\u20131936)\nIn 1930 Lewis published The Apes of God, a biting satirical attack on the London literary scene, including a long chapter caricaturing the Sitwell family, which may have harmed his position in the literary world. In 1937 he published The Revenge for Love, set in the period leading up to the Spanish Civil War and regarded by many as his best novel. It is strongly critical of communist activity in Spain and presents English intellectual fellow travellers as deluded.\nDespite serious illness necessitating several operations, he was very productive as a critic and painter. He produced a book of poems, One-Way Song, in 1933, and a revised version of Enemy of the Stars. An important book of critical essays also belongs to this period: Men without Art (1934). It grew out of a defence of Lewis's satirical practice in The Apes of God and puts forward a theory of 'non-moral', or metaphysical, satire. The book is probably best remembered for one of the first commentaries on Faulkner and a famous essay on Hemingway.\n\nReturn to painting (1936\u20131941)\nAfter becoming better known for his writing than his painting in the 1920s and early 1930s, he returned to more concentrated work on visual art, and paintings from the 1930s and 1940s constitute some of his best-known work. The Surrender of Barcelona (1936\u201337) makes a significant statement about the Spanish Civil War. It was included in an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in 1937 that Lewis hoped would re-establish his reputation as a painter. After the publication in The Times of a letter of support for the exhibition, asking that something from the show be purchased for the national collection (signed by, among others, Stephen Spender, W. H. Auden, Geoffrey Grigson, Rebecca West, Naomi Mitchison, Henry Moore and Eric Gill) the Tate Gallery bought the painting, Red Scene. Like others from the exhibition, it shows an influence from Surrealism and de Chirico's Metaphysical Painting. Lewis was highly critical of the ideology of Surrealism, but admired the visual qualities of some Surrealist art.\nDuring this period, Lewis also produced many of his most well-known portraits, including pictures of Edith Sitwell (1923\u20131936), T. S. Eliot (1938 and 1949), and Ezra Pound (1939). His 1938 portrait of Eliot was rejected by the selection committee of the Royal Academy for their annual exhibition and caused a furore, when Augustus John resigned in protest.\n\nWorld War II and North America (1941\u20131945)\nLewis spent World War II in the United States and Canada. In 1941, in Toronto, he produced a series of watercolor fantasies centered on themes of creation, crucifixion and bathing.\nHe grew to appreciate the cosmopolitan and \"rootless\" nature of the American melting pot, declaring that the greatest advantage of being American was to have \"turned one's back on race, caste, and all that pertains to the rooted state.\" He praised the contributions of African-Americans to American culture, and regarded Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco as the \"best North American artists,\" predicting that when \"the Indian culture of Mexico melts into the great American mass to the North, the Indian will probably give it its art.\" He returned to England in 1945.\n\nLater life and blindness (1945\u20131951)\nBy 1951, he was completely blinded by a pituitary tumor that placed pressure on his optic nerve. It ended his artistic career, but he continued writing until his death. He published several autobiographical and critical works: Rude Assignment (1950), Rotting Hill (1951), a collection of allegorical short stories about his life in \"the capital of a dying empire\"; The Writer and the Absolute (1952), a book of essays on writers including George Orwell, Jean-Paul Sartre and Andr\u00e9 Malraux; and the semi-autobiographical novel Self Condemned (1954).\nThe BBC commissioned Lewis to complete his 1928 work The Childermass, which was published as The Human Age and dramatized for the BBC Third Programme in 1955. In 1956, the Tate Gallery held a major exhibition of his work, \"Wyndham Lewis and Vorticism\", in the catalogue to which he declared that \"Vorticism, in fact, was what I, personally, did and said at a certain period\"\u2014a statement which brought forth a series of \"Vortex Pamphlets\" from his fellow \"BLAST\" signatory William Roberts.\n\nPersonal life\nFrom 1918 to 1921, Lewis lived with Iris Barry, with whom he had two children. He is said to have shown little affection for them.In 1930, Lewis married Gladys Anne Hoskins (1900\u20131979), eighteen years his junior and affectionately known as Froanna. They lived together for ten years before marrying and never had children.Lewis kept Froanna in the background, and many of his friends were simply unaware of her existence. It seems that Lewis was extraordinarily jealous and protective of his wife, owing to her youth and beauty. Froanna was patient and caring toward her husband through financial troubles and his frequent illnesses. She was the model for some of Lewis's most tender and intimate portraits, as well as a number of characters in his fiction. In contrast to his earlier, impersonal portraits, which are purely concerned with external appearance, the portraits of Froanna show a preoccupation with her inner life.Always interested in Roman Catholicism, he never converted. He died in 1957. By the time of his death, Lewis had written 40 books in all.\n\nPolitical views\nIn 1931, after a visit to Berlin, Lewis published Hitler (1931), a book presenting Adolf Hitler as a \"man of peace\" whose party-members were threatened by communist street violence. His unpopularity among liberals and anti-fascists grew, especially after Hitler came to power in 1933. Following a second visit to Germany in 1937, Lewis changed his views and began to retract his previous political comments. he recognized the reality of Nazi treatment of Jews after a visit to Berlin in 1937. In 1939, he published an attack on anti-semitism, The Jews, Are They Human?, which was favorably reviewed in The Jewish Chronicle. He also published The Hitler Cult (1939), which firmly revoked his earlier support for Hitler.Politically, Lewis remained an isolated figure through the 1930s. In Letter to Lord Byron, W. H. Auden called Lewis \"that lonely old volcano of the Right.\" Lewis thought there was what he called a \"left-wing orthodoxy\" in Britain in the 1930s. He believed it was against Britain's self-interest to ally  with the Soviet Union, \"which the newspapers most of us read tell us has slaughtered out-of-hand, only a few years ago, millions of its better fed citizens, as well as its whole imperial family.\"\nIn Anglosaxony: A League that Works (1941), Lewis reflected on his earlier support for fascism:Fascism \u2013 once I understood it \u2013 left me colder than communism. The latter at least pretended, at the start, to have something to do with helping the helpless and making the world a more decent and sensible place. It does start from the human being and his suffering. Whereas fascism glorifies bloodshed and preaches that man should model himself upon the wolf.His sense that America and Canada lacked a British-type class structure had increased his opinion of liberal democracy, and in the same pamphlet, Lewis defends liberal democracy's respect for individual freedom against its critics on both the left and right. In America and Cosmic Man (1949), Lewis argued that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had successfully managed to reconcile individual rights with the demands of the state.Legacy\nIn recent years, there has been renewed critical and biographical interest in Lewis and his work, and he is now regarded as a major British artist and writer of the twentieth century. Rugby School hosted an exhibition of his works in November 2007 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his death. The National Portrait Gallery in London held a major retrospective of his portraits in 2008. Two years later, held at the Fundaci\u00f3n Juan March (Madrid, Spain), a large exhibition (Wyndham Lewis 1882\u20131957) featured a comprehensive collection of Lewis's paintings and drawings. As Tom Lubbock pointed out, it was \"the retrospective that Britain has never managed to get together.\".In 2010, Oxford World Classics published a critical edition of the 1928 text of \"Tarr\", edited by Scott W. Klein of Wake Forest University. The Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University held an exhibition entitled \"The Vorticists: Rebel Artists in London and New York, 1914\u201318\" from 30 September 2010 through 2 January 2011. The exhibition then travelled to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice (29 January \u2013 15 May 2011: \"I Vorticisti: Artisti ribellia a Londra e New York, 1914\u20131918\") and then to Tate Britain under the title \"The Vorticists: Manifesto for a Modern World\" between 14 June and 4 September 2011.\nSeveral readings by Lewis are collected on The Enemy Speaks, an audiobook CD published in 2007 and featuring extracts from \"One Way Song\" and \"The Apes of God\", as well as radio talks titled \"When John Bull Laughs\" (1938), \"A Crisis of Thought\" (1947) and \"The Essential Purposes of Art\" (1951).\nA blue plaque now stands on the house in Kensington, London, where Lewis lived, No. 61 Palace Gardens Terrace.\nCritical reception\nWalter Sickert once claimed that, \"Wyndham Lewis [is] the greatest portraitist of this or any other time.\"In his essay \"Good Bad Books\", George Orwell presents Lewis as the exemplary writer who is cerebral without being artistic. Orwell wrote, \"Enough talent to set up dozens of ordinary writers has been poured into Wyndham Lewis's so-called novels... Yet it would be a very heavy labour to read one of these books right through. Some indefinable quality, a sort of literary vitamin, which exists even in a book like [1922 melodrama] If Winter Comes, is absent from them.\"\nAnti-semitism\nFor many years, Lewis's novels have been criticised for their satirical and hostile portrayals of Jews. Tarr was revised and republished in 1928, giving a new Jewish character a key role in making sure a duel is fought. This has been interpreted as an allegorical representation of a supposed Zionist conspiracy against the West. His literary satire The Apes of God has been interpreted similarly, because many of the characters are Jewish, including the modernist author and editor Julius Ratner, a portrait which blends anti-semitic stereotype with historical literary figures John Rodker and James Joyce.\nA key feature of these interpretations is that Lewis is held to have kept his conspiracy theories hidden and marginalized. Since the publication of Anthony Julius's T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form (1995), where Lewis's anti-semitism is described as \"essentially trivial\", this view is no longer taken seriously.\nBooks\nTarr (1918) (novel)\nThe Caliph's Design\u00a0: Architects!

Merritt \u2013 was an American Sunday magazine editor and a writer of fantastic fiction.The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted him in 1999, its fourth class of two deceased and two living writers.\nLife\nBorn in Beverly, New Jersey, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1894. Originally trained in law, he turned to journalism, first as a correspondent and later as editor. According to Peter Haining, Merritt survived a harrowing experience while a young reporter at The Philadelphia Inquirer about which he refused to ever speak, but would, as Haining claims, mark a turning point in Merritt's life. He was assistant editor of The American Weekly from 1912 to 1937 under Morrill Goddard, then its editor from 1937 until his death. As editor, he hired the unheralded new artists Virgil Finlay and Hannes Bok and promoted the work done on polio by Sister Elizabeth Kenny.\nHis fiction, eight complete novels and a number of short stories, was only a sideline to his journalism career. One of the best-paid journalists of his era, Merritt made $25,000 per year by 1919, and at the end of his life was earning $100,000 yearly\u2014exceptional sums for the period. His financial success allowed him to pursue world travel\u2014he invested in real estate in Jamaica and Ecuador\u2014and exotic hobbies, like cultivating orchids and plants linked to witchcraft and magic (monkshood, wolfbane, blue datura, peyote, and cannabis).He was described as a hypochondriac who talked endlessly about his medical symptoms, and showed eccentric behavior like a need to try out any food, tobacco and medicine he found on his coworkers desks. Occasionally he would dress in a kilt and play serenades for his coworkers with some of his huge collection of instruments he kept in a locked closet at work. He was well liked for his fairness and inability to fire any employees.Merritt married twice, once in the 1910s to Eleanore Ratcliffe, with whom he raised an adopted daughter, and again in the 1930s to Eleanor H. Johnson. He lived in the Hollis Park Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York City, where he accumulated collections of weapons, carvings, and primitive masks from his travels, as well as a library of occult literature that reportedly exceeded 5000 volumes. He died suddenly of a heart attack, at his winter home in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida, in 1943.\n\nWriting\nMerritt's writings were heavily influenced by H. Rider Haggard, Robert W. Chambers, Helena Blavatsky and Gertrude Barrows Bennett (writing as Francis Stevens), with Merritt having \"emulated Bennett's earlier style and themes.\" Merritt's stories typically revolve around conventional pulp magazine themes: lost civilizations, hideous monsters, etc. His heroes are gallant Irishmen or Scandinavians, his villains treacherous Germans or Russians and his heroines often virginal, mysterious and scantily clad.\nWhat sets Merritt apart from the typical pulp author, however, is his lush, florid prose style and his exhaustive, at times exhausting, penchant for adjective-laden detail. Merritt's fondness for micro-description nicely complements the pointillistic style of Bok's illustrations.\n\nMerritt's first fantasy story was published in 1917, \"Through the Dragon Glass\" in the November 14 issue of Frank Munsey's All-Story Weekly. Other short stories and serial novels followed in the Munsey magazines All-Story, Argosy All-Story, and Argosy: The People of the Pit (1918), \"The Moon Pool\" (1918), The Conquest of the Moon Pool (1919), \"Three Lines of Old French\" (1919), The Metal Monster (1920), The Face in the Abyss (1923), The Ship of Ishtar (1924), Seven Footprints to Satan (1927), The Snake Mother (1930), Burn Witch Burn! (1932), Dwellers in the Mirage (1932), and Creep, Shadow! (1934). Meanwhile, rather few of his stories appeared elsewhere: The Pool of the Stone God (in his own American Weekly, 1923), The Woman of the Wood (Weird Tales, 1926), The Metal Emperor (Science and Invention, 1927), and The Drone Man (Fantasy Magazine, 1934).Merritt also contributed to the round robin story The Challenge from Beyond with Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, C. L. Moore, and Frank Belknap Long.\nThe Fox Woman and the Blue Pagoda (1946) combined an unfinished story with a conclusion written by Merritt's friend Hannes Bok. The Fox Woman and Other Stories (1949) collected the same fragment, minus Bok's conclusion, with Merritt's short stories. The book The Black Wheel was published in 1948, after Merritt's death; it was written by Bok using previously unpublished material as well. Both these books were also illustrated by Bok and published by the small press The New Collectors Group in hardcover.\nAfter Merritt's death, Sam Moskowitz discovered a number of poems among his papers. Though some may have been written by other authors, they were credited to Merritt when published.\nReputation\nMerritt was a major influence on H. P. Lovecraft and Richard Shaver, and highly esteemed by his friend and frequent collaborator Hannes Bok, a science fiction illustrator. Karl Edward Wagner included Burn Witch Burn on his list of \"The Thirteen Best Supernatural Horror Novels\" in the May 1983 issue of The Twilight Zone Magazine. Michael Moorcock and James Cawthorn list The Ship of Ishtar and Dwellers in the Mirage as two of the novels in their book Fantasy: the 100 Best Books, describing the former book as Merritt \"at the peak of his powers\", and Merritt's work as a whole being full of \"memorable images\". Robert Bloch also included Burn Witch Burn on his list of favourite horror novels Gary Gygax, co-creator of the game Dungeons and Dragons, listed Merritt in \"Appendix N\" of the Dungeon Masters Guide and often noted that he was one of his favorite fantasy authors. In the Lensman series by E. E. Smith, there is a reference to the novel Dwellers in the Mirage in which the protagonist Kimball Kinnison references the book and a quotation from it \"Luka\u2014turn your wheel so I need not slay this woman!\"\n\nWork\nNovels\nThe Moon Pool (fix-up, 1919) Available online(The Moon Pool (1918) + Conquest of the Moon Pool (1919))\nThe Metal Monster (1920) Available online\nThe Ship of Ishtar (1924) Available online\nSeven Footprints to Satan (1927) Available online\nThe Face in the Abyss (fix-up, 1931) Available online (The Face in the Abyss (1923) + The Snake Mother (1930))\nDwellers in the Mirage (1932) Available online\nBurn, Witch, Burn!

As a member of his Party's Pre-Revolutionary underground, Zamyatin was repeatedly arrested, beaten, imprisoned, and exiled. However, Zamyatin was just as deeply disturbed by the policies pursued by the All-Union Communist Party (b) (VKP (b)) following the October Revolution as he had been by the Tsarist policy of Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality.\nDue to his subsequent use of literature to both satirize and criticize the Soviet Union's enforced conformity and increasing totalitarianism, Zamyatin, whom Mirra Ginsburg has dubbed, \"a man of incorruptible and uncompromising courage,\" is now considered one of the first Soviet dissidents. He is most famous for his highly influential and widely imitated 1921 dystopian science fiction novel We, which is set in a futuristic police state.\nIn 1921, We became the first work banned by the Soviet censorship board. Ultimately, Zamyatin arranged for We to be smuggled to the West for publication. The outrage this sparked within the Party and the Union of Soviet Writers led directly to the State-organized defamation and blacklisting of Zamyatin and his successful request for permission from Joseph Stalin to leave his homeland. In 1937, however, Zamyatin died in poverty in Paris.\nAfter his death, Zamyatin's writings were circulated in samizdat and continued to inspire multiple generations of Soviet dissidents. Furthermore, during a 2018 debate in Toronto, English actor Stephen Fry, an activist and vocal public speaker in Leftist and LGBT causes, paraphrased from Zamyatin's 1923 denunciation of Censorship in the Soviet Union in order to also denounce the idea that political correctness and online cancel culture represent social progress.\n\nEarly life\nZamyatin was born in Lebedyan, Tambov Governorate, 300\u00a0km (186\u00a0mi) south of Moscow. His father was a Russian Orthodox priest and schoolmaster, and his mother a musician. In a 1922 essay, Zamyatin recalled, \"You will see a very lonely child, without companions of his own age, on his stomach, over a book, or under the piano, on which his mother is playing Chopin.\"He may have had synesthesia since he gave letters and sounds qualities. For instance, he saw the letter \u041b as having pale, cold and light blue qualities.He studied engineering for the Imperial Russian Navy in Saint Petersburg, from 1902 until 1908. During this time, Zamyatin lost his faith in Christianity, became an Atheist and a Marxist, and joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party.\n1905: Revolt and Repression\nZamyatin later recalled the Russian Revolution of 1905 as follows, \"In those years, being a Bolshevik meant following the line of greatest resistance, and I was a Bolshevik at that time. In the fall of 1905 there were strikes, and the dark Nevsky Prospekt was pierced by a searchlight from the Admiralty Building. October 17. Meetings in the universities.\"In December 1905, Zamyatin agreed to hide in his flat a paper bag filled with the explosive pyroxylin. The following day, he and thirty other Bolsheviks were arrested by the Okhrana inside, \"revolutionary headquarters of the Vyborg district, at the very moment when plans and pistols of various types were spread out on the table.\"After being arrested and beaten up, Zamyatin managed to smuggle a note out of the prison, instructing his fellow Bolsheviks, \"to remove everything compromising from my room and the rooms of my four comrades.\" Although this was immediately done, Zamyatin did not know of it until much later. During the months he spent in solitary confinement, Zamyatin recalled that he had almost daily nightmares about the paper bag in his flat containing pyroxylin.In the spring of 1906, Zamyatin was released and sent into internal exile in his native Tambov Governorate. However, Zamyatin later wrote that he could not stand life among the devoutly Russian Orthodox peasantry of Lebedyan. Therefore, he escaped and returned to Saint Petersburg where he lived illegally before moving to Helsinki, in the Grand Duchy of Finland.After illegally returning to St. Petersburg, \"disguised, clean-shaven, with a pince-nez astride my nose,\" Zamyatin began to write fiction as a hobby. He was arrested and exiled a second time in 1911. He later recalled, \"I lived first in an empty dacha at Sestoretsk, then, in winter, in Lakhta. There amidst snow, solitude, quite, I wrote A Provincial Tales.\"\nLife as a naval engineer\nIn 1913, Zamyatin was amnestied as part of the celebrations for 300-years of rule by the House of Romanov and granted the right to return to St. Petersburg. His A Provincial Tale, which satirized life in a small Russian town, was immediately published and brought him a degree of fame. The next year he was tried and acquitted for defaming the Imperial Russian Army in his story Na Kulichkakh (At the World's End). He continued to contribute articles to various Marxist newspapers. After graduating as an engineer for the Imperial Russian Navy, Zamyatin worked professionally at home and abroad.\n\nSojourn in England\nIn March 1916 he was sent to the United Kingdom to supervise the construction of icebreakers at the shipyards of Armstrong Whitworth in Walker and Swan Hunter  in Wallsend while living in Newcastle upon Tyne. He supervised the building of the Krassin, which retained the distinction of being the most powerful icebreaker in the world into the 1950s. He also worked on the Lenin\nZamyatin later wrote, \"My only previous visit to the West had been to Germany. Berlin had impressed me as a condensed, 80-percent version of Petersburg. In England it was quite different: everything was as new and strange as Alexandria and Jerusalem had been some years before.\"\nZamyatin later recalled, \"In England, I built ships, looked at ruined castles, listened to the thud of bombs dropped by German zeppelins, and wrote The Islanders. I regret that I did not see the February Revolution, and know only the October Revolution (I returned to Petersburg, past German submarines, in a ship with lights out, wearing a life belt the whole time, just in time for October). This is the same as never having been in love and waking up one morning already married for ten years or so.\"\nReturn to Russia\nZamyatin's The Islanders, satirizing English life, and the similarly themed A Fisher of Men, were both published after his return to Russia.\nAccording to Mirra Ginsburg, \"In 1917 he returned to Petersburg and plunged into the seething literary activity that was one of the most astonishing by-products of the revolution in ruined, ravaged, hungry, and epidemic-ridden Russia. He wrote stories, plays, and criticism; he lectured on literature and the writer's craft; he participated in various literary projects and committees - many of them initiated and presided over by Maxim Gorky - and served on various editorial boards, with Gorky, Blok, Korney Chukovsky, Gumilev, Shklovsky, and other leading writers, poets, critics, and linguists. And very soon he came under fire from the newly 'orthodox' - the Proletarian Writers who sought to impose on all art the sole criterion of 'usefulness to the revolution.'\"But, as the Russian Civil War still raged, Zamyatin's writings and statements became increasingly satirical and critical toward the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Even though he was an Old Bolshevik and even though, \"he accepted the revolution,\" Zamyatin believed that independent speech and thought are necessary to any healthy society and opposed the Party's increasing suppression of freedom of speech and the censorship of literature, the media, and the arts.\nIn his 1918 essay Scythians?, Zamyatin wrote, \"Christ on Golgotha, between two thieves, bleeding to death drop by drop, is the victor - because he has been crucified, because, in practical terms, he has been vanquished. But Christ victorious in practical terms is the Grand Inquisitor. And worse, Christ victorious in practical terms is a paunchy priest in a silk-lined purple robe, who dispenses benedictions with his right hand and collects donations with his left. The Fair Lady, in legal marriage, is simply Mrs. So-and-So, with hair curlers at night and a migraine in the morning. And Marx, having come down to earth, is simply a Krylenko. Such is the irony and such is the wisdom of fate. Wisdom because this ironic law holds the pledge of eternal movement forward. The realization, materialisation, practical victory of an idea immediately gives it a philistine hue. And the true Scythian will smell from a mile away the odor of dwellings, the odor of cabbage soup, the odor of the priest in his purple cassock, the odor of Krylenko -- and will hasten away from the dwellings, into the steppe, to freedom.\"Later in the same essay, Zamyatin quoted a recent poem by Andrei Bely and used it to further criticize People's Commissar for Military Affairs Nikolai Krylenko and those like him, for having, \"covered Russia with a pile of carcasses,\" and for, \"dreaming of socialist-Napoleonic Wars in Europe - throughout the world, throughout the universe! But let us not jest incautiously. Bely is honest, and did not intend to speak about the Krylenkos.\"In 1919, Zamyatin wrote, \"He who has found his ideal today is, like Lot's wife, already turned into a pillar of salt and does not move ahead. The world is kept alive only by heretics: the heretic Christ, the heretic Copernicus, the heretic Tolstoy. Our symbol of faith is heresy.\"Zamyatin's novel We, which he wrote between 1920 and 1921, is set many centuries in the future. D-503, a mathematician, lives in the One State, an urban nation constructed almost entirely of glass apartment buildings, which assist mass surveillance by the secret police, or Bureau of Guardians. The structure of the One State is Panopticon-like, and life is scientifically managed based on the theories of F. W. Taylor. People march in step with each other and are uniformed. There is no way of referring to people except by numbers assigned by the One State. The society is run strictly by logic or reason as the primary justification for the laws or the construct of the society. The individual's behaviour is based on logic by way of formulas and equations outlined by the One State.As the novel opens, the spaceship Integral is being built in order to visit extraterrestrial planets. In a deliberate swipe at the expansionist dreams of Nikolai Krylenko and others like him, the One State intends to \"force\" alien races \"to be happy\" by accepting the absolutism of the One State and its leader, the Benefactor. Meanwhile, as the spaceship's chief engineer, D-503 begins a journal that he intends to be carried upon the completed spaceship.\nLike all other citizens of One State, D-503 lives in a glass apartment building and is carefully watched by the Bureau of Guardians. D-503's lover, O-90, has been assigned by the One State to visit him on certain nights. She is considered too short to bear children and is deeply grieved by her state in life. O-90's other lover and D-503's best friend is R-13, a State poet who reads his verse at public executions.\nWhile on an assigned walk with O-90, D-503 meets a woman named I-330. I-330 smokes cigarettes, drinks vodka, and shamelessly flirts with D-503 instead of applying for a pink ticket sex visit; all of these are highly illegal according to the laws of One State.\nBoth repelled and fascinated, D-503 struggles to overcome his attraction to I-330. He begins to have dreams, which are thought to be a symptom of mental illness. Slowly, I-330 reveals to D-503 that she is in a member of MEPHI, an organization of rebels against the One State. I-330 also takes D-503 through secret tunnels to the untamed wilderness outside the Green Wall, which surrounds the city-state. There, D-503 meets human inhabitants whom the One State claims do not exist: hunter gatherers whose bodies are covered with animal fur. The aims of MEPHI are to topple the One State, destroy the Green Wall, and reunite the people of the city with the outside world.\nLike many other dystopian novels, We does not end happily for I-330 and D-503, it also ends with a general uprising by MEPHI and the One State's survival in doubt. A recurring theme throughout We is that, just as there is no highest number, there can be no final revolution.\nNot surprisingly, the Soviet Government refused to allow We to be published.\nIn his 1921 essay I Am Afraid, Zamyatin began by criticizing the poets who unconditionally sang the praises of the new Soviet Government. Zamyatin compared them with the Court Poets under the House of Romanov and under the French House of Bourbon. Zamyatin further criticized, \"these nimble authors,\" for knowing, \"when to sing hail to the Tsar, and when to the Hammer and Sickle.\" Zamyatin then wrote: \"True literature can exist only when it is created, not by diligent and reliable officials, but by madmen, hermits, heretics, dreamers, rebels and skeptics.\" Zamyatin continued by pointing out that writers in the new Soviet Union were forbidden to criticize and satirise, in the vein of Jonathan Swift and Anatole France, the foibles and failings of the new society. Zamyatin added that, while many compared Russia after the October Revolution to the Athenian democracy at its inception, the Athenian government and people did not fear the satirical stage plays of Aristophanes, in which everyone was mocked and criticized. Zamyatin concluded by pointing out that if the Party did not rid itself of, \"this new Catholicism, which is every bit as fearful of every heretical word as the old one,\" then the only future possible for Russian literature was \"in the past.\"In Zamyatin's 1923 essay, The New Russian Prose, he wrote, \"In art, the surest way to destroy is to canonize one given form and one philosophy: that which is canonized dies of obesity, of entropy.\"In his 1923 essay, On Literature, Revolution, Entropy, and Other Matters, Zamyatin wrote, \"The law of revolution is red, fiery, deadly; but this death means the birth of a new life, a new star. And the law of entropy is cold, ice blue, like the icy interplanetary infinities. The flame turns from red to an even, warm pink, no longer deadly, but comfortable. The sun ages into a planet, convenient for highways, stores,  beds, prostitutes, prisons; this is the law. And if the planet is to be kindled into youth again, it must be set on fire, it must be thrown off the smooth highway of evolution: this is the law. The flame will cool tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow (in the Book of Genesis days are equal to years, ages). But someone must see this already, and speak heretically today about tomorrow. Heretics are the only (bitter) remedy against the entropy of human thought. When the flaming, seething sphere (in science, religion, social life, art) cools, the fiery magma becomes coated with dogma - a rigid, ossified, motionless crust. Dogmatization in science, religion, social life, or art is the entropy of thought. What has become dogma no longer burns; it only gives off warmth - it is tepid, it is cool. Instead of the Sermon on the Mount, under the scorching sun, to upraised-arms and sobbing people, there is drowsy prayer in a magnificent abbey. Instead of Galileo's, 'Be still, it turns!' there are dispassionate computations in a well-heated room in an observatory. On the Galileos, the epigones build their own structures, slowly, bit by bit, like corals. This is the path of evolution - until a new heresy explodes the crush of dogma and all the edifices of the most enduring which have been raised upon it. Explosions are not very comfortable. And therefore the exploders, the heretics, are justly exterminated by fire, by axes, by words. To every today, to every civilization, to the laborious, slow, useful, most useful, creative, coral-building work, heretics are a threat. Stupidly, recklessly, they burst into today from tomorrow; they are romantics. Babeuf was justly beheaded in 1797; he leaped into 1797 across 150 years. It is just to chop off the head of a heretical literature which challenges dogma; this literature is harmful. But harmful literature is more useful than useful literature, for it is anti-entropic, it is a means of challenging calcification, sclerosis, crust, moss, quiescence. It is Utopian, absurd - like Babeuf in 1797. It is right 150 years later.\"Zamyatin also wrote a number of short stories, in fairy tale form, that constituted satirical criticism of Communist ideology. According to Mirra Ginsburg, \"Instead of idealized eulogies to the Revolution, Zamyatin wrote stories like The Dragon, The Cave, and A Story about the Most Important Thing, reflecting the starkness and the territory the time: the little man lost in his uniform, transformed into a dragon with a gun; the starving, frozen intellectual reduced to stealing a few logs of wood; the city turned into a barren, prehistoric landscape - a desert of caves and cliffs and roaring mammoths; fratricide and destruction and blood. In The Church of God, he questions the Bolshevik tenet that the end justifies the means. In The Flood, he gives the central place to individual passions against a background that reflects the vast changes of the time as marginally and obliquely as they are reflected in the consciousness of his characters - residents of an outlying suburb, whose knowledge of the history around them is limited to such facts as the deteriorating quality of coal, the silent machines, the lack of bread.\"In 1923, Zamyatin arranged for the manuscript of his dystopian science fiction novel We to be smuggled to E.P. Dutton and Company in New York City. After being translated into English by Russian refugee Gregory Zilboorg, the novel was published in 1924.\nThen, in 1927, Zamyatin went much further. He smuggled the original Russian text to Marc Lvovich Slonim (1894\u20131976), the editor of an anti-communist Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 magazine and publishing house based in Prague. To the fury of the Soviet State, copies of the Czechoslovakian edition began being smuggled back to the USSR and secretly passed from hand to hand. Zamyatin's secret dealings with Western publishers triggered a mass offensive by the Soviet State against him.\nThese attitudes, writings, and actions, which the Party considered Deviationism made Zamyatin's position increasingly difficult as the 1920s wore on. Zamyatin became, according to Mirra Ginsburg, one of \"the first to become the target of concerted hounding by the Party critics and writers.\"According to Mirra Ginsburg, \"Zamyatin's vision was too far-reaching, too nonconformist, and too openly expressed to be tolerated by the purveyors of official and compulsory dogma. Very early he was branded by Trotsky as an internal \u00e9migr\u00e9. He was repeatedly attacked as a bourgeois intellectual, out of tune with the revolution. When the Party-line Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP) gained full sway in the latter 1920s, with the end of the New Economic Policy and the introduction of the first Five Year Plan, it set out systematically to all originality and independence in the arts. Art had to serve the ends of the Party or it had no right to exist.\"Max Eastman, an American Communist who had similarly broken with his former beliefs, described the Politburo's war against Zamyatin in his book Artists in Uniform.According to Mirra Ginsburg, \"All the instruments of power were brought into use in the campaign for conformity. Faced with grim alternatives, most of Zamyatin's erstwhile pupils and colleagues yielded to pressure, recanted publicly, in many cases rewrote their works, and devoted themselves to turning out the gray eulogies to Communist construction demanded by the dictatorship. Other writers, like Babel and Olesha, chose silence. Many committed suicide. Zamyatin's destruction took a different form. One of the most active and influential figures in the All-Russian Writers' Union, which included a variety of literary schools, he became the object of a frenzied campaign of vilification. He was dismissed from his editorial posts; magazines and publishing houses closed their doors to him; those which ventured to publish his work were persecuted; his plays were withdrawn from the stage. Under the pressure of the Party inquisitors, his friends began to be afraid to see him and many of his comrades in the Writer's Union denounced him. He was, in effect, presented with the choice of repudiating his work and his views, or total expulsion from literature.\"Instead of surrendering, Zamyatin, whom Ginsburg has dubbed, \"a man of incorruptible and uncompromising courage,\" on 24 September 1929, wrote and mailed a letter resigning his membership in the Union of Soviet Writers. According to Mirra Ginsburg, \"...in his letter of resignation, he wrote that it was impossible for him to remain in a literary organization which, even indirectly, took part in the persecution of its members.\"In 1931, Zamyatin appealed directly to Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin, requesting permission to leave the Soviet Union. In this letter Zamyatin wrote, \"I do not wish to conceal that the basic reason for my request for permission to go abroad with my wife is my hopeless position here as a writer, the death sentence that has been pronounced upon me as a writer here at home.\"During the spring of 1931, Zamyatin asked Maxim Gorky, to intercede with Stalin on his behalf.After Gorky's death, Zamyatin wrote, \"One day, Gorky's secretary telephoned to say that Gorky wished me to have dinner with him at his country home. I remember clearly that extraordinarily hot day and the rainstorm - a tropical downpour- in Moscow. Gorky's car sped through a wall of water, bringing me and several other invited guests to dinner at his home. It was a literary dinner, and close to twenty people sat around the table. At first Gorky was silent, visibly tired. Everybody drank wine, but his glass contained water - he was not allowed to drink wine. After a while, he rebelled, poured himself a glass of wine, then another and another, and became the old Gorky. The storm ended, and I walked out onto the large stone terrace. Gorky followed me immediately and said to me, 'The affair of your passport is settled. But if you wish, you can return the passport and stay.' I said I would go. Gorky frowned and went back to the other guests in the dining room. It was late. Some of the guests remained overnight; others, including myself, were returning to Moscow. In parting, Gorky said, 'When shall we meet again? If not in Moscow, then perhaps in Italy? If I go there, you must come to see me! In any case, until we meet again, eh?' This was the last time I saw Gorky.\"\nLife in exile\nAfter their emigration, Zamyatin and his wife settled in Paris. According to Mirra Ginsburg, \"Zamyatin's last years in Paris were years of great material hardship and loneliness. As Remizov wrote, 'He came with sealed lips and a sealed heart.' He found little in common with most of the emigr\u00e9s who had left Russia a decade earlier.\"The screenplay to Jean Renoir's 1936 film adaptation of Maxim Gorky's stage play The Lower Depths was co-written by Zamyatin.\nZamyatin later wrote, \"Gorky was informed of this, and wrote that he was pleased at my participation in the project, that he would like to see the adaptation of his play, and would wait to receive the manuscript. The manuscript was never sent: by the time it was ready for mailing, Gorky was dead.\"According to Mirra Ginsburg, after the film premiered, \"He wrote some articles for French magazines and worked on a novel, The Scourge of God. Its central character was Attila, whose epoch, he felt, paralleled our own. The novel was never finished.\"\nDeath and burial\nYevgeny Zamyatin died in poverty of a heart attack on March 10, 1937. Only a small group of friends were present for his burial at the Cimeti\u00e8re de Thiais, in the Parisian suburb of the same name.\nOne of the mourners, however, was Zamyatin's Russian language publisher Marc Lvovich Slonim, who had befriended the Zamyatins after their arrival in the West. Mirra Ginsburg later wrote of Zamyatin, \"His death went unreported in the Soviet press.\"\nLegacy\nWriting in 1967,  Mirra Ginsburg commented, \"Like Bulgakov and like Babel, Zamyatin gives us a glimpse of what post-revolutionary Russian literature might have become had independence, daring, and individuality not been stamped out so ruthlessly by the dictatorship. The Russian reader - and by the same token, the Russian writer - was deprived of the work of these rich and germinal writers, and the effects, alas, are sadly evident.\"But even as she wrote the words that have just been quoted, Ginzburg's understanding of Soviet society was incomplete. The writings of Yevgeny Zamyatin, like those of all other writers whose works were banned by the State, were already being circulated in secret. In what was termed samizdat, or \"self-publishing\", hand-typed paper copies of Zamyatin's novel and his short stories were copied in secret, read, and then passed from hand-to-hand.\nThe Communist Party of the Soviet Union's vengeance, however, against Zamyatin for sending his novel We to the West for publication was remembered by Soviet poets and writers long after the writer's death. This is why it was 1957 before another Soviet writer took the risk of doing so again. In that year, when he handed the manuscript to his novel Doctor Zhivago over to an emissary from billionaire Italian publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, Boris Pasternak famously said, \"You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad.\"\nEven though Pasternak was accordingly subjected to State-organized character assassination, ostracism, and blacklisting almost identical to what had been experienced by Zamyatin, Pasternak's decision to publish Doctor Zhivago in the West also helped him to win the 1958 Nobel Prize for Literature.\nNot surprisingly, many other Soviet dissidents after Pasternak would also go on to both use and expand upon the ideas and tactics pioneered by the author of We. For example, Alexander Solzhenitsyn was Christianizing Zamyatin's attacks against State-enforced conformity when he wrote, in his 1973 Letter to Soviet Leaders, \"Our present system is unique in world history, because over and above its physical and economic constraints, it demands of us total surrender of our souls, continuous and willing participation in the general, conscious lie. To this putrefaction of the soul, this spiritual enslavement, human beings who wish to be human cannot submit. When Caesar, having exacted what is Caesar's, demands still more insistently that we render unto him what is God's - that is a sacrifice we dare not make.\"In the same year, Solzhenitsyn responded to the KGB's seizure of a hidden manuscript of The Gulag Archipelago, his nonfiction expos\u00e9 of the Soviet secret police, the Soviet concentration camps, and the role of Vladimir Lenin in setting up both, by ordering his publisher in France to publish the whole book immediately. This resulted, as with Zamyatin, in Solzhenitsyn's departure from his homeland. Unlike Zamyatin, however, Solzhenitsyn was not given a choice in the matter.\nAs part of last Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's reformist policies of glasnost and perestroika, Zamyatin's writing began to again be published legally in his homeland in 1988.\nEven since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Zamyatin's many denunciations of enforced conformity and groupthink, as well as his belief that writers and intellectuals have a duty to oppose the calcification and entropy of human thought has meant that his writings continue to have both readers and admirers.\nFor example, while arguing alongside Jordan Peterson during the 2018 Munk Debates in Toronto against the idea that political correctness and online cancel culture represent social progress, English LGBT actor and comedian Stephen Fry paraphrased from Yevgeny Zamyatin's 1923 essay against censorship, I Am Afraid; \"Progress is not achieved by preachers and guardians of morality, but by madmen, hermits, heretics, dreamers, rebels, and skeptics.\"\nScience Fiction\nWe has often been discussed as a political satire aimed at the police state of the Soviet Union. There are many other dimensions, however. It may variously be examined as (1) a polemic against the optimistic scientific socialism of H. G. Wells, whose works Zamyatin had previously published, and with the heroic verses of the (Russian) Proletarian Poets, (2) as an example of Expressionist theory, and (3) as an illustration of the archetype theories of Carl Jung as applied to literature.\nGeorge Orwell believed that Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) must be partly derived from We. However, in a 1962 letter to Christopher Collins, Huxley says that he wrote Brave New World as a reaction to H.G. Wells' utopias long before he had heard of We. Kurt Vonnegut said that in writing Player Piano (1952) he \"cheerfully ripped off the plot of Brave New World, whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin's We.\"In 1994, We received a Prometheus Award in the Libertarian Futurist Society's \"Hall of Fame\" category.We, the 1921 Russian novel, directly inspired:\n\nAldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932)\nAyn Rand's Anthem (1938)\nGeorge Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949)\nKurt Vonnegut's Player Piano (1952)\nUrsula K.

His father was an engineer with the SNCF.\n\nLiterary career\nHe became a professional writer in 1909, after having worked for two years in a high school as an aggregated teacher. By this time, he was already known as a left-leaning intellectual. In 1910 he launched  L\u2019Effort libre, a \"review of revolutionary civilization\". He joined the French Army in World War I and was injured three times on the battlefields of the Marne and in Verdun. After the war, he felt remorse for having joined the army. He also suffered from neurosis caused by the horrors of war and by the premature death of his youngest daughter, Solange. It was during this time that Bloch traveled to Africa on the advice of a friend. His logbook made during this maritime voyage was published in newspapers and magazines of the period and was later serialized into a three volume book set.In 1937, he was responsible for organising Naissance d'une cit\u00e9, a \"popular spectacle\" performed on 19 October as part of the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne.\nFamily life\nAndr\u00e9 Maurois was his brother in law.\nLiterary works\nA Publisher of \"L'Effort Libre\", 1910\u20131914 (left-wing literary magazine)\nL\u00e9vy, 1912\n... et Compagnie, 1918 (novel)\nLa nuit Kurde (novel)\nSybilla, 1932 (novel)\nCarnaval est mort, 1920 (critic)\nA leader of \"Europe\" (with Jean Gu\u00e9henno)\nOffrande \u00e0 la musique, 1930 (ballet)\nDestin du si\u00e8cle, 1931\nNaissance d'une culture, 1936\nToulon (a play)\nDe la France trahie \u00e0 la France en armes, 1949References\nExternal links\n Media related to Jean-Richard Bloch at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nPercy Wyndham Lewis (18 November 1882 \u2013 7 March 1957) was an English writer, painter, and critic. He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art and edited BLAST, the literary magazine of the Vorticists.His novels include Tarr (1918) and The Human Age trilogy, composed of The Childermass (1928), Monstre Gai (1955) and Malign Fiesta (1955). A fourth volume, titled The Trial of Man, was unfinished at the time of his death. He also wrote two autobiographical volumes: Blasting and Bombardiering (1937) and Rude Assignment: A Narrative of my Career Up-to-Date (1950).\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nLewis was born on 18 November 1882, reputedly on his father's yacht off the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. His English mother, Anne Stuart Lewis (n\u00e9e Prickett), and American father, Charles Edward Lewis, separated about 1893. His mother subsequently returned to England. Lewis was educated in England at Rugby School and then Slade School of Fine Art, University College London. He spent most of the 1900s travelling around Europe and studying art in Paris. While in Paris, he attended lectures by Henri Bergson on process philosophy.\n\nEarly work and development of Vorticism (1908\u20131915)\nIn 1908, Lewis moved to London, where he would reside for much of his life. In 1909, he published his first work, accounts of his travels in Brittany, in Ford Madox Ford's The English Review. He was a founding member of the Camden Town Group, which brought him into close contact with the Bloomsbury Group, particularly Roger Fry and Clive Bell, with whom he soon fell out.\nIn 1912, Lewis exhibited his work at the second Postimpressionist exhibition: Cubo-Futurist illustrations to Timon of Athens and three major oil paintings. In 1912, he was commissioned to produce a decorative mural, a drop curtain, and more designs for The Cave of the Golden Calf, an avant-garde cabaret and nightclub on Heddon Street.From 1913 to 1915, Lewis developed the style of geometric abstraction for which he is best known today, which his friend Ezra Pound dubbed \"Vorticism.\" Lewis sought to combine the strong structure of Cubism, which he found was not \"alive,\" with the liveliness of Futurist art, which lacked structure. The combination was a strikingly dramatic critique of modernity. In his early visual works, Lewis may have been influenced by Bergson's process philosophy. Though he was later savagely critical of Bergson, he admitted in a letter to Theodore Weiss (19 April 1949) that he \"began by embracing his evolutionary system.\" Nietzsche was an equally important influence.\nLewis had a brief tenure at Roger Fry's Omega Workshops, but left after a quarrel with Fry over a commission to provide wall decorations for the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition, which Lewis believed Fry had misappropriated. He and several other Omega artists started a competing workshop called the Rebel Art Centre. The Centre operated for only four months, but it gave birth to the Vorticist group and its publication, BLAST. In BLAST, Lewis formally expounded the Vorticist aesthetic in a manifesto, distinguishing it from other avant-garde practices. He also wrote and published a play, Enemy of the Stars. It is a proto-absurdist, Expressionist drama. Lewis scholar Melania Terrazas identifies it as a precursor to the plays of Samuel Beckett.\nWorld War I (1915\u20131918)\nIn 1915, the Vorticists held their only U.K. exhibition before the movement broke up, largely as a result of World War I. Lewis himself was posted to the western front and served as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. Much of his time was spent in Forward Observation Posts looking down at apparently deserted German lines, registering targets and calling down fire from batteries massed around the rim of the Ypres Salient. He made vivid accounts of narrow misses and deadly artillery duels.After the Third Battle of Ypres, Lewis was appointed as an official war artist for both the Canadian and British governments. For the Canadians, he painted A Canadian Gun-pit (1918) from sketches made on Vimy Ridge. For the British, he painted one of his best-known works, A Battery Shelled (1919), drawing on his own experience at Ypres. Lewis exhibited his war drawings and some other paintings of the war in an exhibition, \"Guns\", in 1918.\nAlthough the Vorticist group broke up after the war, Lewis's patron, John Quinn, organized a Vorticist exhibition at the Penguin Club in New York in 1917. His first novel, Tarr, was serialized in The Egoist during 1916\u201317 and published in book form in 1918. It is widely regarded as one of the key modernist texts.Lewis later documented his experiences and opinions of this period of his life in the autobiographical Blasting and Bombardiering (1937), which covered his life up to 1926.\n\nTyros and writing (1918\u20131929)\nAfter the war, Lewis resumed his career as a painter with a major exhibition, Tyros and Portraits, at the Leicester Galleries in 1921. \"Tyros\" were satirical caricatures intended to comment on the culture of the \"new epoch\" that succeeded the First World War. A Reading of Ovid and Mr Wyndham Lewis as a Tyro are the only surviving oil paintings from this series. Lewis also launched his second magazine, The Tyro, of which there were only two issues. The second (1922) contained an important statement of Lewis's visual aesthetic: \"Essay on the Objective of Plastic Art in our Time\". It was during the early 1920s that he perfected his incisive draughtsmanship.\nBy the late 1920s, he concentrated on writing. He launched yet another magazine, The Enemy (1927\u20131929), largely written by himself and declaring its belligerent critical stance in its title. The magazine and other theoretical and critical works he published from 1926 to 1929 mark a deliberate separation from the avant-garde and his previous associates. He believed that their work failed to show sufficient critical awareness of those ideologies that worked against truly revolutionary change in the West, and therefore became a vehicle for these pernicious ideologies. His major theoretical and cultural statement from this period is The Art of Being Ruled (1926).\nTime and Western Man (1927) is a cultural and philosophical discussion that includes penetrating critiques of James Joyce, Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound that are still read. Lewis also attacked the process philosophy of Bergson, Samuel Alexander, Alfred North Whitehead, and others.\nFiction and political writing (1930\u20131936)\nIn 1930 Lewis published The Apes of God, a biting satirical attack on the London literary scene, including a long chapter caricaturing the Sitwell family, which may have harmed his position in the literary world. In 1937 he published The Revenge for Love, set in the period leading up to the Spanish Civil War and regarded by many as his best novel. It is strongly critical of communist activity in Spain and presents English intellectual fellow travellers as deluded.\nDespite serious illness necessitating several operations, he was very productive as a critic and painter. He produced a book of poems, One-Way Song, in 1933, and a revised version of Enemy of the Stars. An important book of critical essays also belongs to this period: Men without Art (1934). It grew out of a defence of Lewis's satirical practice in The Apes of God and puts forward a theory of 'non-moral', or metaphysical, satire. The book is probably best remembered for one of the first commentaries on Faulkner and a famous essay on Hemingway.\n\nReturn to painting (1936\u20131941)\nAfter becoming better known for his writing than his painting in the 1920s and early 1930s, he returned to more concentrated work on visual art, and paintings from the 1930s and 1940s constitute some of his best-known work. The Surrender of Barcelona (1936\u201337) makes a significant statement about the Spanish Civil War. It was included in an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in 1937 that Lewis hoped would re-establish his reputation as a painter. After the publication in The Times of a letter of support for the exhibition, asking that something from the show be purchased for the national collection (signed by, among others, Stephen Spender, W. H. Auden, Geoffrey Grigson, Rebecca West, Naomi Mitchison, Henry Moore and Eric Gill) the Tate Gallery bought the painting, Red Scene. Like others from the exhibition, it shows an influence from Surrealism and de Chirico's Metaphysical Painting. Lewis was highly critical of the ideology of Surrealism, but admired the visual qualities of some Surrealist art.\nDuring this period, Lewis also produced many of his most well-known portraits, including pictures of Edith Sitwell (1923\u20131936), T. S. Eliot (1938 and 1949), and Ezra Pound (1939). His 1938 portrait of Eliot was rejected by the selection committee of the Royal Academy for their annual exhibition and caused a furore, when Augustus John resigned in protest.\n\nWorld War II and North America (1941\u20131945)\nLewis spent World War II in the United States and Canada. In 1941, in Toronto, he produced a series of watercolor fantasies centered on themes of creation, crucifixion and bathing.\nHe grew to appreciate the cosmopolitan and \"rootless\" nature of the American melting pot, declaring that the greatest advantage of being American was to have \"turned one's back on race, caste, and all that pertains to the rooted state.\" He praised the contributions of African-Americans to American culture, and regarded Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco as the \"best North American artists,\" predicting that when \"the Indian culture of Mexico melts into the great American mass to the North, the Indian will probably give it its art.\" He returned to England in 1945.\n\nLater life and blindness (1945\u20131951)\nBy 1951, he was completely blinded by a pituitary tumor that placed pressure on his optic nerve. It ended his artistic career, but he continued writing until his death. He published several autobiographical and critical works: Rude Assignment (1950), Rotting Hill (1951), a collection of allegorical short stories about his life in \"the capital of a dying empire\"; The Writer and the Absolute (1952), a book of essays on writers including George Orwell, Jean-Paul Sartre and Andr\u00e9 Malraux; and the semi-autobiographical novel Self Condemned (1954).\nThe BBC commissioned Lewis to complete his 1928 work The Childermass, which was published as The Human Age and dramatized for the BBC Third Programme in 1955. In 1956, the Tate Gallery held a major exhibition of his work, \"Wyndham Lewis and Vorticism\", in the catalogue to which he declared that \"Vorticism, in fact, was what I, personally, did and said at a certain period\"\u2014a statement which brought forth a series of \"Vortex Pamphlets\" from his fellow \"BLAST\" signatory William Roberts.\n\nPersonal life\nFrom 1918 to 1921, Lewis lived with Iris Barry, with whom he had two children. He is said to have shown little affection for them.In 1930, Lewis married Gladys Anne Hoskins (1900\u20131979), eighteen years his junior and affectionately known as Froanna. They lived together for ten years before marrying and never had children.Lewis kept Froanna in the background, and many of his friends were simply unaware of her existence. It seems that Lewis was extraordinarily jealous and protective of his wife, owing to her youth and beauty. Froanna was patient and caring toward her husband through financial troubles and his frequent illnesses. She was the model for some of Lewis's most tender and intimate portraits, as well as a number of characters in his fiction. In contrast to his earlier, impersonal portraits, which are purely concerned with external appearance, the portraits of Froanna show a preoccupation with her inner life.Always interested in Roman Catholicism, he never converted. He died in 1957. By the time of his death, Lewis had written 40 books in all.\n\nPolitical views\nIn 1931, after a visit to Berlin, Lewis published Hitler (1931), a book presenting Adolf Hitler as a \"man of peace\" whose party-members were threatened by communist street violence. His unpopularity among liberals and anti-fascists grew, especially after Hitler came to power in 1933. Following a second visit to Germany in 1937, Lewis changed his views and began to retract his previous political comments. he recognized the reality of Nazi treatment of Jews after a visit to Berlin in 1937. In 1939, he published an attack on anti-semitism, The Jews, Are They Human?, which was favorably reviewed in The Jewish Chronicle. He also published The Hitler Cult (1939), which firmly revoked his earlier support for Hitler.Politically, Lewis remained an isolated figure through the 1930s. In Letter to Lord Byron, W. H. Auden called Lewis \"that lonely old volcano of the Right.\" Lewis thought there was what he called a \"left-wing orthodoxy\" in Britain in the 1930s. He believed it was against Britain's self-interest to ally  with the Soviet Union, \"which the newspapers most of us read tell us has slaughtered out-of-hand, only a few years ago, millions of its better fed citizens, as well as its whole imperial family.\"\nIn Anglosaxony: A League that Works (1941), Lewis reflected on his earlier support for fascism:Fascism \u2013 once I understood it \u2013 left me colder than communism. The latter at least pretended, at the start, to have something to do with helping the helpless and making the world a more decent and sensible place. It does start from the human being and his suffering. Whereas fascism glorifies bloodshed and preaches that man should model himself upon the wolf.His sense that America and Canada lacked a British-type class structure had increased his opinion of liberal democracy, and in the same pamphlet, Lewis defends liberal democracy's respect for individual freedom against its critics on both the left and right. In America and Cosmic Man (1949), Lewis argued that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had successfully managed to reconcile individual rights with the demands of the state.Legacy\nIn recent years, there has been renewed critical and biographical interest in Lewis and his work, and he is now regarded as a major British artist and writer of the twentieth century. Rugby School hosted an exhibition of his works in November 2007 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his death. The National Portrait Gallery in London held a major retrospective of his portraits in 2008. Two years later, held at the Fundaci\u00f3n Juan March (Madrid, Spain), a large exhibition (Wyndham Lewis 1882\u20131957) featured a comprehensive collection of Lewis's paintings and drawings. As Tom Lubbock pointed out, it was \"the retrospective that Britain has never managed to get together.\".In 2010, Oxford World Classics published a critical edition of the 1928 text of \"Tarr\", edited by Scott W. Klein of Wake Forest University. The Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University held an exhibition entitled \"The Vorticists: Rebel Artists in London and New York, 1914\u201318\" from 30 September 2010 through 2 January 2011. The exhibition then travelled to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice (29 January \u2013 15 May 2011: \"I Vorticisti: Artisti ribellia a Londra e New York, 1914\u20131918\") and then to Tate Britain under the title \"The Vorticists: Manifesto for a Modern World\" between 14 June and 4 September 2011.\nSeveral readings by Lewis are collected on The Enemy Speaks, an audiobook CD published in 2007 and featuring extracts from \"One Way Song\" and \"The Apes of God\", as well as radio talks titled \"When John Bull Laughs\" (1938), \"A Crisis of Thought\" (1947) and \"The Essential Purposes of Art\" (1951).\nA blue plaque now stands on the house in Kensington, London, where Lewis lived, No. 61 Palace Gardens Terrace.\nCritical reception\nWalter Sickert once claimed that, \"Wyndham Lewis [is] the greatest portraitist of this or any other time.\"In his essay \"Good Bad Books\", George Orwell presents Lewis as the exemplary writer who is cerebral without being artistic. Orwell wrote, \"Enough talent to set up dozens of ordinary writers has been poured into Wyndham Lewis's so-called novels... Yet it would be a very heavy labour to read one of these books right through. Some indefinable quality, a sort of literary vitamin, which exists even in a book like [1922 melodrama] If Winter Comes, is absent from them.\"\nAnti-semitism\nFor many years, Lewis's novels have been criticised for their satirical and hostile portrayals of Jews. Tarr was revised and republished in 1928, giving a new Jewish character a key role in making sure a duel is fought. This has been interpreted as an allegorical representation of a supposed Zionist conspiracy against the West. His literary satire The Apes of God has been interpreted similarly, because many of the characters are Jewish, including the modernist author and editor Julius Ratner, a portrait which blends anti-semitic stereotype with historical literary figures John Rodker and James Joyce.\nA key feature of these interpretations is that Lewis is held to have kept his conspiracy theories hidden and marginalized. Since the publication of Anthony Julius's T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form (1995), where Lewis's anti-semitism is described as \"essentially trivial\", this view is no longer taken seriously.\nBooks\nTarr (1918) (novel)\nThe Caliph's Design\u00a0: Architects!

A member of the Javal family, Maurois was the son of Ernest Herzog, a Jewish textile manufacturer, and his wife Alice L\u00e9vy-Rueff.  His family had fled Alsace after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371 and took refuge in Elbeuf, where they owned a woollen mill. As noted by Maurois, the family brought their entire Alsatian workforce with them to the relocated mill, for which Maurois' grandfather was admitted to the Legion of Honour for having \"saved a French industry\". This family background is reflected in Maurois' \"Bernard Quesnay\" - the story of a young World War I veteran with artistic and intellectual inclinations who is drawn, much against his will, to work as a director in his grandfather's textile mills - a character clearly having many autobiographical elements.During World War I he joined the French army and served as an interpreter (according to Martin Gilbert in Churchill and the Jews, Henry Holt and Company, New York, 2007) and served as an interpreter for Lieutenant Colonel Winston Churchill and later a liaison officer with the British army. His first novel, Les silences du colonel Bramble, was a witty and socially realistic account of that experience. It was an immediate success in France. It was translated and became popular in the United Kingdom and other English-speaking countries as The Silence of Colonel Bramble. Many of his other works have also been translated into English, as they often dealt with British people or topics, such as his biographies of Disraeli, Byron, and Shelley.\nIn 1938 Maurois was elected to the prestigious Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. He was encouraged and assisted in seeking this post by Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, and he made a point of acknowledging with thanks his debt to P\u00e9tain in his 1941 autobiography, \"Call no man happy\" \u2013 though by the time of writing their paths had sharply diverged, P\u00e9tain having become Head of State of Vichy France.\nWhen World War II began, he was appointed the French Official Observer attached to the British General Headquarters. In this capacity he accompanied the British Army to Belgium. He knew personally the main politicians in the French Government, and on 10 June 1940 he was sent on a mission to London. After the Armistice ended that mission, Maurois was demobilised and travelled from England to Canada. He wrote of these experiences in his book, Tragedy in France.Later in World War II he served in the French army and the Free French Forces.\nHis Maurois pseudonym became his legal name in 1947.\nHe died in 1967 in Neuilly-sur-Seine after a long career as an author of novels, biographies, histories, children's books and science fiction stories. He is buried in Neuilly-sur-Seine community cemetery near Paris.\n\nFamily\nMaurois's first wife was Jeanne-Marie Wanda de Szymkiewicz, a young Polish-Russian aristocrat who had studied at Oxford University. She had a nervous breakdown in 1918 and in 1924 she died of sepsis. After the death of his father, Maurois gave up the family business of textile manufacturing (in the 1926 novel \"Bernard Quesnay\" he in effect described an alternative life of himself, in which he would have plunged into the life of a textile industrialist and given up everything else).\nMaurois's second wife was Simone de Caillavet, daughter of playwright Gaston Arman de Caillavet and actress Jeanne Pouquet, and granddaughter of Anatole France's mistress L\u00e9ontine Arman de Caillavet. After the fall of France in 1940, the couple moved to the United States to help with propaganda work against the Nazis.Jean-Richard Bloch was his brother-in-law.\nQuotations\n\"The minds of different generations are as impenetrable one by the other as are the monads of Leibniz.\" (Ariel, 1923.)\n\"Without a family, man, alone in the world, trembles with the cold.\"Bibliography\nBooks\nLes silences du colonel Bramble, Paris: Grasset, 1918 (includes \"Si\u2014\", a French translation of Kipling's poem \"If\u2014\").\nThe Silence of Colonel Bramble, London: John Lane, The Bodley Head, 1919 (English translation of The Silence of Colonel Bramble; text translated from the French by Thurfrida Wake; verse translated by Wilfrid Jackson).\nNi ange, ni b\u00eate, Paris: Grasset, 1919; English translation: Neither Angel, Nor Beast, Lincoln, Nebraska: Infusionmedia, 2015 (translated by Preston and Sylvie Shires).\nLes Discours du docteur O'Grady, Paris: Grasset, 1922 (\"Le Roman\" series); English translation: The Silence of Colonel Bramble; and, The Discourses of Doctor O'Grady, London: Bodley Head, 1965.\nClimats, Paris: Grasset, 1923; Paris, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9dition \"Le livre\", 1929 (illustrated by Jean Hugo); English translation: Whatever Gods May Be, London: Cassell, 1931 (translated by Joseph Collins).\nAriel, ou La vie de Shelley, Paris: Grasset, 1923; English translation: Ariel: The Life of Shelley, New York: D.

His collected works represent, among other things, an extended reflection upon the dehumanising effects of modernity and industrialisation. Lawrence's writing explores issues such as sexuality, emotional health, vitality, spontaneity, and instinct. His works include Sons and Lovers, The Rainbow, Women in Love, and Lady Chatterley's Lover.\nLawrence's opinions earned him many enemies and he endured official persecution, censorship, and misrepresentation of his creative work throughout the second half of his life, much of which he spent in a voluntary exile he called his \"savage pilgrimage\". At the time of his death, his public reputation was that of a pornographer who had wasted his considerable talents. E. M. Forster, in an obituary notice, challenged this widely held view, describing him as \"the greatest imaginative novelist of our generation.\" Later, the literary critic F. R. Leavis championed both his artistic integrity and his moral seriousness.\n\nLife and career\nEarly life\nThe fourth child of Arthur John Lawrence, a barely literate miner at Brinsley Colliery, and Lydia Beardsall, a former pupil-teacher who had been forced to perform manual work in a lace factory due to her family's financial difficulties, Lawrence spent his formative years in the coal mining town of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. The house in which he was born, 8a Victoria Street, is now the D. H. Lawrence Birthplace Museum. His working-class background and the tensions between his parents provided the raw material for a number of his early works. Lawrence roamed out from an early age in the patches of open, hilly country and remaining fragments of Sherwood Forest in Felley woods to the north of Eastwood, beginning a lifelong appreciation of the natural world, and he often wrote about \"the country of my heart\" as a setting for much of his fiction.\nThe young Lawrence attended Beauvale Board School (now renamed Greasley Beauvale D. H. Lawrence Primary School in his honour) from 1891 until 1898, becoming the first local pupil to win a county council scholarship to Nottingham High School in nearby Nottingham. He left in 1901, working for three months as a junior clerk at Haywood's surgical appliances factory, but a severe bout of pneumonia ended this career. During his convalescence he often visited Hagg's Farm, the home of the Chambers family, and began a friendship with Jessie Chambers. An important aspect of this relationship with Chambers and other adolescent acquaintances was a shared love of books, an interest that lasted throughout Lawrence's life. \nIn the years 1902 to 1906 Lawrence served as a pupil-teacher at the British School, Eastwood. He went on to become a full-time student and received a teaching certificate from University College, Nottingham (then an external college of University of London), in 1908. During these early years he was working on his first poems, some short stories, and a draft of a novel, Laetitia, which was eventually to become The White Peacock. At the end of 1907 he won a short story competition in the Nottinghamshire Guardian, the first time that he had gained any wider recognition for his literary talents.\n\nEarly career\nIn the autumn of 1908, the newly qualified Lawrence left his childhood home for London. While teaching in Davidson Road School, Croydon, he continued writing. Jessie Chambers submitted some of Lawrence's early poetry to Ford Madox Ford (then known as Ford Hermann Hueffer), editor of the influential The English Review. Hueffer then commissioned the story Odour of Chrysanthemums which, when published in that magazine, encouraged Heinemann, a London publisher, to ask Lawrence for more work. His career as a professional author now began in earnest, although he taught for another year. \nShortly after the final proofs of his first published novel, The White Peacock, appeared in 1910, Lawrence's mother died of cancer. The young man was devastated, and he was to describe the next few months as his \"sick year\". Due to Lawrence's close relationship with his mother, his grief became a major turning point in his life, just as the death of his character, Mrs. Morel, is a major turning point in his autobiographical novel Sons and Lovers, a work that draws upon much of the writer's provincial upbringing. Essentially concerned with the emotional battle for Lawrence's love between his mother and \"Miriam\" (in reality Jessie Chambers), the novel also documents Lawrence's  (through his protagonist, Paul) brief intimate relationship with Chambers that Lawrence had finally initiated in the Christmas of 1909, ending it in August 1910. The hurt this caused Chambers and finally, by her portrayal in the novel ended their friendship; after it was published, they never spoke again.\nIn 1911, Lawrence was introduced to Edward Garnett, a publisher's reader, who acted as a mentor and became a valued friend, as did his son David. Throughout these months, the young author revised Paul Morel, the first draft of what became Sons and Lovers. In addition, a teaching colleague, Helen Corke, gave him access to her intimate diaries about an unhappy love affair, which formed the basis of The Trespasser, his second novel. In November 1911, Lawrence came down with a pneumonia again; once recovered, he abandoned teaching in order to become a full-time writer. In February 1912, he broke off an engagement to Louie Burrows, an old friend from his days in Nottingham and Eastwood.In March 1912, Lawrence met Frieda Weekley (n\u00e9e von Richthofen), with whom he was to share the rest of his life. Six years his senior, she was married to Ernest Weekley, his former modern languages professor at University College, Nottingham, and had three young children. However, she and Lawrence eloped and left England for Frieda's parents' home in Metz, a garrison town (then in Germany) near the disputed border with France. Lawrence experienced his first encounter with tensions between Germany and France when he was arrested and accused of being a British spy, before being released following an intervention from Frieda's father. After this incident, Lawrence left for a small hamlet to the south of Munich where he was joined by Frieda for their \"honeymoon\", later memorialised in the series of love poems titled Look! We Have Come Through (1917). During 1912 Lawrence wrote the first of his so-called \"mining plays\", The Daughter-in-Law, written in Nottingham dialect. The play was never to be performed, or even published, in Lawrence's lifetime.\n\nFrom Germany, they walked southwards across the Alps to Italy, a journey that was recorded in the first of his travel books, a collection of linked essays titled Twilight in Italy and the unfinished novel, Mr Noon. During his stay in Italy, Lawrence completed the final version of Sons and Lovers. Having become so tired of the manuscript, he allowed Edward Garnett to cut roughly 100 pages from the text. The novel was published in 1913 and hailed as a vivid portrait of the realities of working class provincial life.\nLawrence and Frieda returned to Britain in 1913 for a short visit, during which they encountered and befriended critic John Middleton Murry and New Zealand-born short story writer Katherine Mansfield. \nAlso during that year, on 28 July, Lawrence met Welsh tramp poet W. H. Davies whose nature poetry he greatly admired. Davies collected autographs, and had been particularly keen to obtain Lawrence's signature. Georgian poetry publisher Edward Marsh secured an autograph, probably as part of a signed poem, for Davies, and hosted a meeting in London at which the poet met with Lawrence and his wife. Lawrence was immediately captivated by Davies and later invited him to visit them in Germany. However, despite this early enthusiasm for Davies' work, Lawrence's opinion changed after reading Foliage; whilst in Italy, he also disparaged Nature Poems, calling them \"so thin, one can hardly feel them\".After the couple returned to Italy, staying in a cottage in Fiascherino on the Gulf of Spezia Lawrence wrote the first draft of what would later be transformed into two of his best-known novels, The Rainbow and Women in Love, in which unconventional female characters take centre stage. Both novels were highly controversial and were banned on publication in the UK for obscenity, although Women in Love was banned only temporarily. \nThe Rainbow follows three generations of a Nottinghamshire farming family from the pre-industrial to the industrial age, focusing particularly on a daughter, Ursula, and her aspiration for a more fulfilling life than that of becoming a housebound wife. Women in Love delves into the complex relationships between four major characters, including the sisters Ursula and Gudrun. Both novels explored grand themes and ideas that challenged conventional thought on the arts, politics, economic growth, gender, sexual experience, friendship and marriage. Lawrence's views as expressed in the novels are now thought to be far ahead of his time. The frank and relatively straightforward manner in which he wrote about sexual attraction was ostensibly why the books were initially banned, in particular the mention of same-sex attraction; Ursula has an affair with a woman in The Rainbow, and there is an undercurrent of attraction between the two principal male characters in Women in Love.\nWhile working on Women in Love in Cornwall during 1916\u201317, Lawrence developed a strong relationship with a Cornish farmer named William Henry Hocking, which some scholars believe was possibly romantic, especially considering Lawrence's fascination with the theme of homosexuality in Women in Love. Although Lawrence never made it clear their relationship was sexual, Frieda believed it was. In a letter written during 1913, he writes, \"I should like to know why nearly every man that approaches greatness tends to homosexuality, whether he admits it or not ...\" He is also quoted as saying, \"I believe the nearest I've come to perfect love was with a young coal-miner when I was about 16.\" However, given his enduring and robust relationship with Frieda it is likely that he was primarily \"bi-curious\", and whether he actually ever had homosexual relations remains an open question.Eventually, Frieda obtained her divorce from Ernest Weekley. Lawrence and Frieda returned to Britain shortly before the outbreak of World War I and were legally married on 13 July 1914. During this time, Lawrence worked with London intellectuals and writers such as Dora Marsden, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and others who worked with The Egoist, an important Modernist literary magazine that published some of his work. Lawrence also worked on adapting Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism into English. He also met the young Jewish artist Mark Gertler, with whom he became good friends for a time; Lawrence would later express his admiration for Gertler's 1916 anti-war painting, Merry-Go-Round as \"the best modern picture I have seen. . . it is great and true.\" Gertler would inspire the character Loerke (a sculptor) in Women in Love. \nFrieda's German parentage and Lawrence's open contempt for militarism caused them to be viewed with suspicion and live in near-destitution during wartime Britain; this may have contributed to The Rainbow being suppressed and investigated for its alleged obscenity in 1915. Later, the couple were accused of spying and signaling to German submarines off the coast of Cornwall, where they lived at Zennor. During this period, Lawrence finished his final draft of Women in Love. Not published until 1920, it is now widely recognized as a novel of great dramatic force and intellectual subtlety.\nIn late 1917, after constant harassment by the armed forces and other authorities, Lawrence was forced to leave Cornwall at three days\u2019 notice under the terms of the Defence of the Realm Act. This persecution was later described in an autobiographical chapter of his novel Kangaroo (1923). Lawrence spent a few months of early 1918 in the small, rural village of Hermitage near Newbury, Berkshire. Subsequently, he lived for just under a year (mid-1918 to early 1919) at Mountain Cottage, Middleton-by-Wirksworth, Derbyshire, where he wrote one of his most poetic short stories, \u201cWintry Peacock\u201d. Until 1919, poverty compelled him to shift from address to address.\nDuring this period, he barely survived a severe attack of influenza.\nExile\nAfter the wartime years, Lawrence began what he termed his \"savage pilgrimage\", a time of voluntary exile from his native country. He escaped from Britain at the earliest practical opportunity and returned only twice for brief visits, spending the remainder of his life travelling with Frieda. This wanderlust took him to Australia, Italy, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), the United States, Mexico and the South of France. Abandoning Britain in November 1919, they headed south, first to the Abruzzo region in central Italy and then onwards to Capri and the Fontana Vecchia in Taormina, Sicily. From Sicily they made brief excursions to Sardinia, Monte Cassino, Malta, Northern Italy, Austria and Southern Germany. \nMany of these places appear in Lawrence's writings, including The Lost Girl (for which he won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction), Aaron's Rod and the fragment titled Mr Noon (the first part of which was published in the Phoenix anthology of his works, and the entirety in 1984). He wrote novellas such as The Captain's Doll, The Fox and The Ladybird. In addition, some of his short stories were issued in the collection England, My England and Other Stories. During these years Lawrence also wrote poems about the natural world in Birds, Beasts and Flowers. \nLawrence is often considered one of the finest travel writers in English. Sea and Sardinia describes a brief journey undertaken in January 1921, and focuses on the life of Sardinia\u2019s people. Less well-known is his introduction to Maurice Magnus's, Memoirs of the Foreign Legion, in which Lawrence recalls his visit to the monastery of Monte Cassino. \nHis other nonfiction books include two responses to Freudian psychoanalysis, Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious and Fantasia of the Unconscious; Movements in European History, a school textbook published under a pseudonym, is a reflection of Lawrence\u2019s blighted reputation in Britain.\n\nLater life and career\nIn late February 1922, the Lawrences left Europe behind with the intention of migrating to the United States. They sailed in an easterly direction, first to Ceylon and then on to Australia. A short residence in Darlington, Western Australia, where he met local writer Mollie Skinner, was followed by a brief stop in the small coastal town of Thirroul, New South Wales, during which Lawrence completed Kangaroo, a novel about local fringe politics that also explored his wartime experiences in Cornwall.\nThe Lawrences finally arrived in the United States in September 1922. Lawrence had several times discussed the idea of setting up a utopian community with several of his friends, having written in 1915 to Willie Hopkin, his old socialist friend from Eastwood: \"I want to gather together about twenty souls and sail away from this world of war and squalor and found a little colony where there shall be no money but a sort of communism as far as necessaries of life go, and some real decency\u2026 a place where one can live simply, apart from this civilisation\u2026 [with] a few other people who are also at peace and happy and live, and understand and be free\u2026\"It was with this in mind that they made for Taos, New Mexico, a Pueblo town where many white \u201cbohemians\u201d had settled, including Mabel Dodge Luhan, a prominent socialite. Here they eventually acquired the 160-acre (0.65\u00a0km2) Kiowa Ranch, now called the D. H. Lawrence Ranch, in 1924 from Dodge Luhan in exchange for the manuscript of Sons and Lovers. The couple stayed in New Mexico for two years, with extended visits to Lake Chapala and Oaxaca in Mexico. While Lawrence was in New Mexico, he was visited by Aldous Huxley.\nEditor and book designer Merle Armitage wrote a book about D. H. Lawrence in New Mexico. Taos Quartet in Three Movements was originally to appear in Flair Magazine, but the magazine folded before its publication. This short work describes the tumultuous relationship of D. H. Lawrence, his wife Frieda, artist Dorothy Brett and Mabel Dodge Sterne. Armitage took it upon himself to print 16 hardcover copies of this work for his friends. Richard Pousette-Dart executed the drawings for Taos Quartet, published in 1950.While in the US, Lawrence rewrote and published Studies in Classic American Literature, a set of critical essays begun in 1917 and later described by Edmund Wilson as \"one of the few first-rate books that have ever been written on the subject\". These interpretations, with their insights into symbolism, New England Transcendentalism and the Puritan sensibility, were a significant factor in the revival of the reputation of Herman Melville during the early 1920s. In addition, Lawrence completed a number of new fictional works, including The Boy in the Bush, The Plumed Serpent, St Mawr, The Woman who Rode Away, The Princess and other short stories. He also produced the collection of linked travel writing that became Mornings in Mexico.\n\nA brief voyage to England at the end of 1923 was a failure and Lawrence soon returned to Taos, convinced his life as an author now lay in the United States. However, in March 1925 he suffered a near fatal attack of malaria and tuberculosis while on a third visit to Mexico. Although he eventually recovered, the diagnosis of his condition obliged him to return once again to Europe. He was dangerously ill and the poor health limited his ability to travel for the remainder of his life. The Lawrences made their home in a villa in Northern Italy, living near Florence while he wrote The Virgin and the Gipsy and the various versions of Lady Chatterley's Lover (1928). The latter book, his last major novel, was initially published in private editions in Florence and Paris and reinforced his notoriety. A story set once more in Nottinghamshire about a cross-class relationship between a Lady and her gamekeeper, it broke new ground in describing their sexual relationship in explicit yet literary language. Lawrence hoped to challenge the British taboos around sex: to enable men and women \"\u2026to think sex, fully, completely, honestly, and cleanly.\" Lawrence responded robustly to those who took offense, even publishing satirical poems (Pansies and Nettles) as well as a tract on Pornography and Obscenity.\nThe return to Italy allowed him to renew old friendships; during these years he was particularly close to Aldous Huxley, who was to edit the first collection of Lawrence's letters after his death, along with a memoir. After Lawrence visited a number of local archaeological sites (particularly old tombs) with artist Earl Brewster in April 1927, his collected essays inspired by the excursions were published as Sketches of Etruscan Places, a book that contrasts the lively past with Benito Mussolini's fascism.\nLawrence continued to produce short stories and other works of fiction such as The Escaped Cock (also published as The Man Who Died), an unorthodox reworking of the story of Jesus Christ's Resurrection. \nDuring his final years, Lawrence renewed his serious interest in oil painting. Official harassment persisted and an exhibition of his paintings at the Warren Gallery in London was raided by the police in mid 1929 and a number of works were confiscated.\n\nDeath\nLawrence continued to write despite his failing health. In his last months he wrote numerous poems, reviews and essays, as well as a robust defence of his last novel against those who sought to suppress it. His last significant work was a reflection on the Book of Revelation, Apocalypse. After being discharged from a sanatorium, he died on 2 March 1930 at the Villa Robermond in Vence, France, from complications of tuberculosis. Frieda commissioned an elaborate headstone for his grave bearing a mosaic of his adopted emblem of the phoenix. After Lawrence's death, Frieda lived with the couple's friend Angelo Ravagli on their Taos ranch and eventually married him in 1950. In 1935, Ravagli arranged, on Frieda's behalf, to have Lawrence's body exhumed and cremated and his ashes brought back to the ranch to be interred there in a small chapel amid the mountains of New Mexico.\nWritten works\nNovels\nLawrence is best known for his novels Sons and Lovers, The Rainbow, Women in Love and Lady Chatterley's Lover. In these books, Lawrence explores the possibilities for life within an industrial setting. In particular Lawrence is concerned with the nature of relationships that can be had within such a setting. Though often classed as a realist, Lawrence in fact uses his characters to give form to his personal philosophy. His depiction of sexuality, though seen as shocking when his work was first published in the early 20th century, has its roots in this highly personal way of thinking and being.\n\nIt is worth noting that Lawrence was very interested in the sense of touch and that his focus on physical intimacy has its roots in a desire to restore an emphasis on the body, and re-balance it with what he perceived to be Western civilisation's over-emphasis on the mind; writing in a 1929 essay \"Men Must Work and Women As Well\", he stated,\"Now we see the trend of our civilization, in terms of human feeling and human relation. It is, and there is no denying it, towards a greater and greater abstraction from the physical, towards a further and further physical separateness between men and women, and between individual and individual\u2026 It only remains for some men and women, individuals, to try to get back their bodies and preserve the flow of warmth, affection and physical unison.\" Phoenix II: Uncollected Writings, Ed. Warren Roberts and Harry T. Moore (New York) 1970In his later years Lawrence developed the potentialities of the short novel form in St Mawr, The Virgin and the Gypsy and The Escaped Cock.\nShort stories\nLawrence's best-known short stories include \"The Captain's Doll\", \"The Fox\", \"The Ladybird\", \"Odour of Chrysanthemums\", \"The Princess\", \"The Rocking-Horse Winner\", \"St Mawr\", \"The Virgin and the Gypsy\" and \"The Woman who Rode Away\". (The Virgin and the Gypsy was published as a novella after he died.) Among his most praised collections is The Prussian Officer and Other Stories, published in 1914. His collection The Woman Who Rode Away and Other Stories, published in 1928, develops the theme of leadership that Lawrence also explored in novels such as Kangaroo and The Plumed Serpent and the story Fanny and Annie.\n\nPoetry\nLawrence wrote almost 800 poems, most of them relatively short. His first poems were written in 1904 and two of his poems, \"Dreams Old\" and \"Dreams Nascent\", were among his earliest published works in The English Review. It has been claimed that his early works clearly place him in the school of Georgian poets, and indeed some of his poems appear in the Georgian Poetry anthologies. However, James Reeves in his book on Georgian Poetry, notes that Lawrence was never really a Georgian poet.  Indeed, later critics contrast Lawrence's energy and dynamism with the complacency of Georgian poetry.\nJust as the First World War dramatically changed the work of many of the poets who saw service in the trenches, Lawrence's own work dramatically changed, during his years in Cornwall. During this time, he wrote free verse influenced by Walt Whitman. He set forth his manifesto for much of his later verse in the introduction to New Poems. \"We can get rid of the stereotyped movements and the old hackneyed associations of sound or sense. We can break down those artificial conduits and canals through which we do so love to force our utterance. We can break the stiff neck of habit [\u2026] But we cannot positively prescribe any motion, any rhythm.\"\n\nLawrence rewrote some of his early poems when they were collected in 1928. This was in part to fictionalise them, but also to remove some of the artifice of his first works. As he put it himself: \"A young man is afraid of his demon and puts his hand over the demon's mouth sometimes and speaks for him.\" His best-known poems are probably those dealing with nature such as those in the collection Birds, Beasts and Flowers, including the Tortoise poems, and \"Snake\", one of his most frequently anthologised, displays some of his most frequent concerns: those of man's modern distance from nature and subtle hints at religious themes.\nLook! We have come through! is his other work from the period of the end of the war and it reveals another important element common to much of his writings; his inclination to lay himself bare in his writings. Ezra Pound in his Literary Essays complained of Lawrence's interest in his own \"disagreeable sensations\" but praised him for his \"low-life narrative.\" This is a reference to Lawrence's dialect poems akin to the Scots poems of Robert Burns, in which he reproduced the language and concerns of the people of Nottinghamshire from his youth.\n\n\nAlthough Lawrence's works after his Georgian period are clearly in the modernist tradition, they were often very different from those of many other modernist writers, such as Pound. Pound's poems were often austere, with every word carefully worked on. Lawrence felt all poems had to be personal sentiments, and that a sense of spontaneity was vital. He called one collection of poems Pansies, partly for the simple ephemeral nature of the verse, but also as a pun on the French word panser, to dress or bandage a wound. \"Pansies\", as he made explicit in the introduction to New Poems, is also a pun on Blaise Pascal's Pens\u00e9es. \"The Noble Englishman\" and \"Don't Look at Me\" were removed from the official edition of Pansies on the grounds of obscenity, which wounded him. Even though he lived most of the last ten years of his life abroad, his thoughts were often still on England. Published in 1930, just eleven days after his death, his last work Nettles  was a series of bitter, nettling but often wry attacks on the moral climate of England.\n\n\nTwo notebooks of Lawrence's unprinted verse were posthumously published as Last Poems and More Pansies. These contain two of Lawrence's most famous poems about death, \"Bavarian Gentians\" and \"The Ship of Death\".\n\nLiterary criticism\nLawrence's criticism of other authors often provides insight into his own thinking and writing. Of particular note is his Study of Thomas Hardy and Other Essays. In Studies in Classic American Literature Lawrence's responses to writers like Walt Whitman, Herman Melville and Edgar Allan Poe also shed light on his craft.\nPlays\nLawrence wrote A Collier's Friday Night about 1906\u20131909, though it was not published till 1939 and not performed till 1965; The Daughter-in-Law in 1913, although it was not staged till 1967, when it was well received. In 1911 he wrote The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd, which he revised in 1914; it was staged in the US in 1916 and in the UK in 1920, in an amateur production. It was filmed in 1976; an adaptation was shown on television (BBC 2) in 1995. He also wrote Touch and Go towards the end of the First World War and his last play, David, in 1925, in the US.\n\nPainting\nD. H. Lawrence had a lifelong interest in painting, which became one of his main forms of expression in his last years. His paintings were exhibited at the Warren Gallery in London's Mayfair in 1929. The exhibition was extremely controversial, with many of the 13,000 people visiting mainly to gawk. The Daily Express claimed, \"Fight with an Amazon represents a hideous, bearded man holding a fair-haired woman in his lascivious grip while wolves with dripping jaws look on expectantly, [this] is frankly indecent\". However, several artists and art experts praised the paintings. Gwen John, reviewing the exhibition in Everyman, spoke of Lawrence's \"stupendous gift of self-expression\" and singled out The Finding of Moses, Red Willow Trees and Boccaccio Story as \"pictures of real beauty and great vitality\". Others singled out Contadini for special praise. After a complaint, the police seized thirteen of the twenty-five paintings (including Boccaccio Story and Contadini). Despite declarations of support from many writers, artists and Members of Parliament, Lawrence was able to recover his paintings only by agreeing never to exhibit them in England again. The largest collection of the paintings is now at La Fonda de Taos hotel in Taos, New Mexico. Several others, including Boccaccio Story and Resurrection, are at the Humanities Research Centre of the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nLady Chatterley trial\nA heavily censored abridgement of Lady Chatterley's Lover was published in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf in 1928. This edition was posthumously re-issued in paperback there both by Signet Books and by Penguin Books in 1946. When the full unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover was published by Penguin Books in Britain in 1960, the trial of Penguin under the Obscene Publications Act of 1959 became a major public event and a test of the new obscenity law. The 1959 act (introduced by Roy Jenkins) had made it possible for publishers to escape conviction if they could show that a work was of literary merit. One of the objections was to the frequent use of the word \"fuck\" and its derivatives and the word \"cunt\".\nVarious academic critics and experts of diverse kinds, including E. M. Forster, Helen Gardner, Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams and Norman St John-Stevas, were called as witnesses, and the verdict, delivered on 2 November 1960, was \"not guilty\". This resulted in a far greater degree of freedom for publishing explicit material in the UK. The prosecution was ridiculed for being out of touch with changing social norms when the chief prosecutor, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, asked if it were the kind of book \"you would wish your wife or servants to read\".\nThe Penguin second edition, published in 1961, contains a publisher's dedication, which reads: \"For having published this book, Penguin Books were prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act, 1959 at the Old Bailey in London from 20 October to 2 November 1960. This edition is therefore dedicated to the twelve jurors, three women and nine men, who returned a verdict of 'Not Guilty' and thus made D. H. Lawrence's last novel available for the first time to the public in the United Kingdom.\"\n\nPhilosophy and politics\nDespite often writing about political, spiritual and philosophical matters, Lawrence was essentially contrary by nature and hated to be pigeon-holed. Critics such as Terry Eagleton have argued that Lawrence was right-wing due to his lukewarm attitude to democracy, which he intimated would tend towards the levelling down of society and the subordination of the individual to the sensibilities of the \u2018average\u2019 man. In his letters to Bertrand Russell around the year 1915, Lawrence voiced his opposition to enfranchising the working class and his hostility to the burgeoning labour movements, and disparaged the French Revolution, referring to \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity\" as the \"three-fanged serpent\". Rather than a republic, Lawrence called for an absolute dictator and equivalent dictatrix to lord over the lower peoples. In 1953, recalling his relationship with Lawrence in the First World War, Russell characterised Lawrence as a \"proto-German Fascist\", saying \"I was a firm believer in democracy, whereas he had developed the whole philosophy of Fascism before the politicians had thought of it.\"    Russell felt Lawrence to be a positive force for evil. However, in 1924 Lawrence wrote an epilogue to Movements in European History (a text book he wrote, originally published in 1921) in which he denounced fascism and Soviet-style socialism as bullying and \u201ca mere worship of Force\u201d. Further, he declared \u201c\u2026 I believe a good form of socialism, if it could be brought about, would be the best form of government.\u201d In the late 1920s, he told his sister he would vote Labour if he was living back in England. In general though, Lawrence disliked any organised groupings, and in his essay Democracy written in the late twenties, he argued for a new kind of democracy in which,\n\n...each man shall be spontaneously himself \u2013 each man himself, each woman herself, without any question of equality entering in at all; and that no man shall try to determine the being of any other man, or of any other woman.\nLawrence held seemingly contradictory views on feminism. The evidence of his written works, particularly his earlier novels, indicates a commitment to representing women as strong, independent and complex; he produced major works in which young, self-directing female characters were central. In his youth he supported extending the vote to women, and once wrote, \u201cAll women in their natures are like giantesses. They will break through everything and go on with their own lives.\u201d  However, a number of feminist critics, notably Kate Millett, have criticised, indeed ridiculed Lawrence's sexual politics, Millett claiming that he uses his female characters as mouthpieces to promote his creed of male supremacy, and that his story The Woman Who Rode Away showed Lawrence as a pornographic sadist with its portrayal of \u201chuman sacrifice performed upon the woman to the greater glory and potency of the male.\u201d Brenda Maddox further highlights this story and two others written around the same time, St. Mawr and The Princess, as \u201cmasterworks of misogyny\u201d.Despite the inconsistency and at times inscrutability of his philosophical writings Lawrence continues to find an audience, and the ongoing publication of a new scholarly edition of his letters and writings has demonstrated the range of his achievement. Philosophers like Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari found in Lawrence's critique of Sigmund Freud an important precursor of anti-Oedipal accounts of the unconscious that has been much influential.\nPosthumous reputation\nThe obituaries shortly after Lawrence's death were, with the exception of the one by E. M. Forster, unsympathetic or hostile. However, there were those who articulated a more favourable recognition of the significance of this author's life and works. For example, his long-time friend Catherine Carswell summed up his life in a letter to the periodical Time and Tide published on 16 March 1930. In response to his critics, she wrote:In the face of formidable initial disadvantages and lifelong delicacy, poverty that lasted for three quarters of his life and hostility that survives his death, he did nothing that he did not really want to do, and all that he most wanted to do he did. He went all over the world, he owned a ranch, he lived in the most beautiful corners of Europe, and met whom he wanted to meet and told them that they were wrong and he was right. He painted and made things, and sang, and rode. He wrote something like three dozen books, of which even the worst page dances with life that could be mistaken for no other man's, while the best are admitted, even by those who hate him, to be unsurpassed. Without vices, with most human virtues, the husband of one wife, scrupulously honest, this estimable citizen yet managed to keep free from the shackles of civilisation and the cant of literary cliques. He would have laughed lightly and cursed venomously in passing at the solemn owls\u2014each one secretly chained by the leg\u2014who now conduct his inquest. To do his work and lead his life in spite of them took some doing, but he did it, and long after they are forgotten, sensitive and innocent people\u2014if any are left\u2014will turn Lawrence's pages and will know from them what sort of a rare man Lawrence was.Aldous Huxley also defended Lawrence in his introduction to a collection of letters published in 1932. However, the most influential advocate of Lawrence's literary reputation was Cambridge literary critic F. R. Leavis, who asserted that the author had made an important contribution to the tradition of English fiction. Leavis stressed that The Rainbow, Women in Love, and the short stories and tales were major works of art. Later, the obscenity trials over the unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover in America in 1959, and in Britain in 1960, and subsequent publication of the full text, ensured Lawrence's popularity (and notoriety) with a wider public.\nSince 2008, an annual D. H. Lawrence Festival has been organised in Eastwood to celebrate Lawrence's life and works; in September 2016, events were held in Cornwall to celebrate the centenary of Lawrence's connection with Zennor.\nSelected depictions of Lawrence's life\nPriest of Love: a 1981 film based on the non-fiction biography of Lawrence of the same name. It stars Ian McKellen as Lawrence. The film is mostly focused on Lawrence's time in Taos, New Mexico, and Italy, although the source biography covers most of his life.\nComing Through: a 1985 film about Lawrence, who is portrayed by Kenneth Branagh.\nZennor in Darkness, a 1993 novel by Helen Dunmore in which Lawrence and his wife feature prominently.\nOn the Rocks: a 2008 stage play by Amy Rosenthal showing Lawrence, his wife Frieda Lawrence, short-story writer Katherine Mansfield and critic and editor John Middleton Murry in Cornwall in 1916\u201317.\nLAWRENCE \u2013 Scandalous!

He was awarded the Grand Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1958. He was a lifelong Catholic.\n\nBiography\nFran\u00e7ois Charles Mauriac was born in Bordeaux, France. He studied literature at the University of Bordeaux, graduating in 1905, after which he moved to Paris to prepare for postgraduate study at the \u00c9cole des Chartes.\nOn 1 June 1933 he was elected a member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, succeeding Eug\u00e8ne Brieux.A former Action fran\u00e7aise supporter, he turned to the left during the Spanish Civil War, criticizing the Catholic Church for its support of Franco. After the fall of France to the Axis during the Second World War, he briefly supported the collaborationist r\u00e9gime of Marshal P\u00e9tain, but joined the Resistance as early as December 1941. He was the only member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise to publish a Resistance text with the Editions de Minuit.\nMauriac had a bitter dispute with Albert Camus immediately following the Liberation of France. At that time, Camus edited the Resistance paper Combat (thereafter an overt daily, until 1947), while Mauriac wrote a column for Le Figaro. Camus said newly liberated France should purge all Nazi collaborator elements, but Mauriac warned that such disputes should be set aside in the interests of national reconciliation. Mauriac also doubted that justice would be impartial or dispassionate given the emotional turmoil of the Liberation. Despite having been viciously criticised by Robert Brasillach he campaigned against his execution.\nMauriac also had a bitter public dispute with Roger Peyrefitte, who criticised the Vatican in books such as Les Cl\u00e9s de saint Pierre (1953). Mauriac threatened to resign from the paper he was working with at the time (L'Express) if they did not stop carrying advertisements for Peyrefitte's books. The quarrel was exacerbated by the release of the film adaptation of Peyrefitte's Les Amiti\u00e9s Particuli\u00e8res and culminated in a virulent open letter by Peyrefitte in which he accused Mauriac of homosexual tendencies and called him a Tartuffe, hypocrite.Mauriac was opposed to French rule in Vietnam, and strongly condemned the use of torture by the French army in Algeria.\nIn 1952 he won the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for the deep spiritual insight and the artistic intensity with which he has in his novels penetrated the drama of human life\". He was awarded the Grand Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1958. He published a series of personal memoirs and a biography of Charles de Gaulle.\nMauriac's complete works were published in twelve volumes between 1950 and 1956. He encouraged Elie Wiesel to write about his experiences as a Jew during the Holocaust, and wrote the foreword to Elie Wiesel's book Night.\nHe was the father of writer Claude Mauriac and grandfather of Anne Wiazemsky, a French actress and author who worked with and married French director Jean-Luc Godard.\nFran\u00e7ois Mauriac died in Paris on 1 September 1970 and was interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Vemars, Val d'Oise, France.\n\nAwards and honours\n1926 \u2014 Grand Prix du roman de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\n1933 \u2014 Member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\n1952 \u2014 Nobel Prize in Literature\n1958 \u2014 Grand Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneurWorks\nNovels, novellas and short stories\n1913 \u2013 L'Enfant charg\u00e9 de cha\u00eenes (\u00abYoung Man in Chains\u00bb, tr. 1961)\n1914 \u2013 La Robe pr\u00e9texte (\u00abThe Stuff of Youth\u00bb, tr. 1960)\n1920 \u2013 La Chair et le Sang (\u00abFlesh and Blood\u00bb, tr. 1954)\n1921 \u2013 Pr\u00e9s\u00e9ances (\u00abQuestions of Precedence\u00bb, tr. 1958)\n1922 \u2013 Le Baiser au l\u00e9preux (\u00abThe Kiss to the Leper\u00bb, tr. 1923 \/ \u00abA Kiss to the Leper\u00bb, tr. 1950)\n1923 \u2013 Le Fleuve de feu (\u00abThe River of Fire\u00bb, tr. 1954)\n1923 \u2013 G\u00e9nitrix (\u00abGenetrix\u00bb, tr. 1950)\n1923 \u2013 Le Mal (\u00abThe Enemy\u00bb, tr. 1949)\n1925 \u2013 Le D\u00e9sert de l'amour  (\u00abThe Desert of Love\u00bb, tr. 1949) (Awarded the Grand Prix du roman de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, 1926.)\n1927 \u2013 Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Desqueyroux (\u00abTh\u00e9r\u00e8se\u00bb, tr. 1928 \/ \u00abTh\u00e9r\u00e8se Desqueyroux\u00bb, tr. 1947 and 2005)\n1928 \u2013 Destins (\u00abDestinies\u00bb, tr. 1929 \/ \u00abLines of Life\u00bb, tr. 1957)\n1929 \u2013 Trois R\u00e9cits A volume of three stories: Coups de couteau, 1926; Un homme de lettres, 1926; Le D\u00e9mon de la connaissance, 1928\n1930 \u2013 Ce qui \u00e9tait perdu (\u00abSuspicion\u00bb, tr. 1931 \/ \u00abThat Which Was Lost\u00bb, tr. 1951)\n1932 \u2013 Le N\u0153ud de vip\u00e8res (\u00abVipers' Tangle\u00bb, tr. 1933 \/ \u00abThe Knot of Vipers\u00bb, tr. 1951)\n1933 \u2013 Le Myst\u00e8re Frontenac (\u00abThe Frontenac Mystery\u00bb, tr. 1951 \/ \u00abThe Frontenacs\u00bb, tr. 1961)\n1935 \u2013 La Fin de la nuit (\u00abThe End of the Night\u00bb, tr. 1947)\n1936 \u2013 Les Anges noirs (\u00abThe Dark Angels\u00bb, tr. 1951 \/ \u00abThe Mask of Innocence\u00bb, tr. 1953)\n1938 \u2013 Plong\u00e9es A volume of five stories: Th\u00e9r\u00e8se chez le docteur, 1933 (\u00abTh\u00e9r\u00e8se and the Doctor\u00bb, tr. 1947); Th\u00e9r\u00e8se \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel, 1933 (\u00abTh\u00e9r\u00e8se at the Hotel\u00bb, tr. 1947); Le Rang; Insomnie; Conte de No\u00ebl.\n1939 \u2013 Les Chemins de la mer (\u00abThe Unknown Sea\u00bb, tr. 1948)\n1941 \u2013 La Pharisienne (\u00abA Woman of Pharisees\u00bb, tr. 1946)\n1951 \u2013 Le Sagouin (\u00abThe Weakling\u00bb, tr. 1952 \/ \u00abThe Little Misery\u00bb, tr. 1952) (A novella)\n1952 \u2013 Galiga\u00ef (\u00abThe Loved and the Unloved\u00bb, tr. 1953)\n1954 \u2013 L'Agneau (\u00abThe Lamb\u00bb, tr. 1955)\n1969 \u2013 Un adolescent d'autrefois (\u00abMaltaverne\u00bb, tr. 1970)\n1972 \u2013 Maltaverne (the unfinished sequel to the previous novel; posthumously published)Plays\n1938 \u2013 Asmod\u00e9e (\u00abAsmod\u00e9e; or, The Intruder\u00bb, tr. 1939 \/ \u00abAsmod\u00e9e: A Drama in Three Acts\u00bb, tr. 1957)\n1945 \u2013 Les Mal Aim\u00e9s\n1948 \u2013 Passage du malin\n1951 \u2013 Le Feu sur terrePoetry\n1909 \u2013 Les Mains jointes\n1911 \u2013 L'Adieu \u00e0 l'Adolescence\n1925 \u2013 Orages\n1940 \u2013 Le Sang d'AtysMemoirs\n1931 \u2013 Holy Thursday: an Intimate Remembrance\n1960 \u2013 M\u00e9moires int\u00e9rieurs\n1962 \u2013 Ce Que Je Crois\n1964 \u2013 Soir\u00e9e Tu DanseBiography\n1937 \u2013 Life of Jesus\n1964 - De Gaulle de Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac (French edition), 1966 English -(Doubleday)Essays and criticism\n1919 \u2013 Petits Essais de Psychologie Religieuse: De quelques coeurs inquiets.

He edited the magazine La Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise (NRF) from 1919 until his death. He was influential in winning a general public acceptance of Marcel Proust as an important writer. His friend and brother-in-law was Alain-Fournier (Henri Alban-Fournier), with whom he exchanged an abundant correspondence.\nBiography\nRivi\u00e8re was born in Bordeaux, the son of an eminent physician. He became friends with Henri-Alban Fournier (later known as Alain-Fournier) at the Lyc\u00e9e Lakanal in Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine. Both students prepared for the entrance examination for the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and both failed. Rivi\u00e8re returned to Bordeaux in 1905, and from that date until his death maintained a frequent correspondence with Alban-Fournier. \nRivi\u00e8re obtained an arts degree in Bordeaux, performed his military service, and returned in 1907 to Paris. There he prepared a thesis at the Sorbonne on the Theodicy of F\u00e9nelon, while earning a living as a teacher at the Stanislas College. He was influenced by Maurice Barr\u00e8s, Andr\u00e9 Gide and Paul Claudel, with whom he corresponded.\nOn 24 August 1909, Rivi\u00e8re married Isabelle Alban-Fournier, his friend Henri's younger sister. In 1913, he explicitly declared his Catholicism.\nAfter writing for the literary revue L'Occident, Rivi\u00e8re became a sub-editor of the NRF in 1912. He also began to write literary criticism, which he collected and published with the title \u00c9tudes (Studies). The essays in this book reveal Rivi\u00e8re's excellent sense of psychology.\nRivi\u00e8re was mobilized in 1914 in the 220th infantry, and was captured on 24 August, in an early battle. Imprisoned in a camp near K\u00f6nigsbr\u00fcck, Saxony, he attempted several escapes, which caused him to be transferred to a disciplinary camp in H\u00fclsberg, Hanover. His memoirs of his captivity there were published in 1918 with the title L'Allemand\u00a0: souvenirs et r\u00e9flexions d'un prisonnier de guerre (The German: memories and reflections of a prisoner of war). Eventually he became seriously ill, and was transferred to Switzerland where he was interned until the end of the war.\nSoon after the end of the war, Rivi\u00e8re restarted the NRF (thee publication of which had been stopped during the war). With Rivi\u00e8re's direction, publication of the NRF resumed on 1 June 1919, and it later published the works of such writers as Marcel Proust, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Saint-John Perse, Jean Giraudoux and Jules Romains. Rivi\u00e8re is remembered primarily for his 1923\u201324 exchange of letters with Antonin Artaud, for the remarkable ways Artaud resists Rivi\u00e8re's attempts at critical, literary, even psychological reduction. About this time Rivi\u00e8re largely neglected his own career as a writer, and wrote only one short psychological novel, Aim\u00e9, published in 1922. At Proust's insistence, he was awarded the Prix Blumenthal in 1920.Rivi\u00e8re died of typhoid fever on 14 February 1925 in Paris. After his death, Rivi\u00e8re's wife devoted herself to the posthumous classification and publication of many of his works.\n\nWorks\n\u00c9tudes (1912)\nL\u2019Allemand\u00a0: souvenirs et r\u00e9flexions d'un prisonnier de guerre (1918)\nAim\u00e9e (1922)\n\u00c0 la trace de Dieu (1925)\nCorrespondance de Jacques Rivi\u00e8re et Alain-Fournier (1926\u20131928)\nCorrespondance avec Paul Claudel (1926)\nCarnet de guerre (1929)\nRimbaud (1931)\nMoralisme et Litt\u00e9rature, dialogue avec Ramon Fern\u00e1ndez (1932)\nFlorence (1935) (unfinished novel)\nCarnets 1914-1917 (1977)References\n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nSalvador de Madariaga y Rojo (23 July 1886 \u2013 14 December 1978) was a Spanish diplomat, writer, historian, and pacifist. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and the Nobel Peace Prize. He was awarded the Charlemagne Prize in 1973.\n\nLife\nDe Madariaga graduated with a degree in engineering in Paris, France. He then went to work as an engineer for the Northern Spanish Railway Company but abandoned this work to return to London and become a journalist, writing in English, for The Times. At this time, he began publishing his first essays. He became a press member of the Secretariat of the League of Nations in 1921, and chief of the Disarmament Section in 1922. In 1928, he was appointed Professor of Spanish at Oxford University for three years, during which time he wrote a book on nation psychology called Englishmen, Frenchmen, Spaniards.\nIn 1931, he was appointed ambassador to the United States of America and a permanent delegate to the League of Nations, a post he kept for 5 years. Chairing the Council of the League of Nations in January 1932, he condemned Japanese aggression in Manchuria in such vehement terms that he was nicknamed \"Don Quijote de la Manchuria\". Between 1932 and 1934, he was Ambassador to France. In 1933, he was elected to the National Congress, serving as both Minister for Education and Minister for Justice. In July 1936, as a classical liberal he went into exile in England to escape the Spanish civil war. From there he became a vocal opponent of, and organised resistance to, the Nacionales and the Spanish State of Francisco Franco. In 1947, he was one of the principal authors of the Oxford Manifesto on liberalism. He participated in the Hague Congress in 1948 as president of the Cultural Commission and he was one of the co-founders, in 1949, of the College of Europe.\nIn his writing career he wrote books and essays about Don Quixote, Christopher Columbus, Shakespeare's Hamlet, and the history of Latin America. He militated in favour of a united and integrated Europe. He wrote in French and German as well as Spanish and Galician (his mother tongue) and English. In 1973 he won the Karlspreis for contributions to the European idea and European peace. In 1976, he returned to Spain after the death of Francisco Franco. The Madariaga European Foundation has been named after him, promoting his vision of a united Europe making for a more peaceful world. The 1979\u20131980 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.\n\nPrivate life\nIn 1912 he married Constance Archibald, a Scottish economic historian. The couple had two daughters, Nieves Mathews (1917\u20132003) and professor and historian Isabel de Madariaga (1919\u20132014). Constance died in May 1970, and in November de Madariaga married Emilia Sz\u00e9kely de Rauman who had been his secretary since 1938. She died in 1991, aged 83.\nAn Oxfordshire blue plaque in honour of Salvador de Madariaga was unveiled at 3 St Andrew's Road, Headington, Oxford by his daughter Isabel on 15 October 2011.\nSelected published works in English\nEnglishmen, Frenchmen, Spaniards: An Essay in Comparative Psychology, Oxford University Press, 1929\nDisarmament, Coward-McCann, 1929\nAnarchy or Hierarchy, Macmillan, 1937\nChristopher Columbus, Macmillan, 1940\nThe Heart of Jade, Creative Age Press, 1944\nThe Rise of the Spanish-American Empire, Hollis & Carter; Macmillan, 1947\nThe Fall of the Spanish-American Empire, Hollis & Carter, 1947; Macmillan, 1948\nBolivar\nMorning without Noon, 1973\nEl Coraz\u00f3n de Piedra Verde, 1942 ('Heart of Jade', the most widely admired of his twelve novels)\nSpain: a Modern History\nHern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s \u2013 Conqueror of Mexico, Macmillan, 1941\nThe Blowing up of the Parthenon, 1960\nOn Hamlet, Hollis & Carter, 1948\nLatin America, Between the Eagle and the Bear, Praeger, 1962See also\nContributions to liberal theory\nList of peace activistsReferences\nExternal links\nMadariaga \u2013 College of Europe Foundation\nMadariaga tennis Club in A Coru\u00f1a.\nMadariaga European College.\nArchival sources by and on Salvador de Madariaga can be consulted at the Historical Archives of the European Union in Florence\nNewspaper clippings about Salvador de Madariaga in the 20th Century Press Archives of the ZBW\nWashington Post obituary\n\n","111":"\n\nCharles Walter Stansby Williams (20 September 1886 \u2013 15 May 1945) was a British poet, novelist, playwright, theologian, literary critic, and member of the   Inklings, an informal literary discussion group associated with C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien at the University of Oxford.\n\nEarly life and education\nWilliams was born in London in 1886, the only son of (Richard) Walter Stansby Williams (1848\u20131929), a journalist and foreign business correspondent for an importing firm, writing in French and German, who was a 'regular and valued' contributor of verse, stories and articles to many popular magazines, and his wife Mary (n\u00e9e Wall, the sister of the ecclesiologist and historian J. Charles Wall), a former milliner (hatmaker), of Islington. He had one sister, Edith, born in 1889. The Williams family lived in 'shabby-genteel' circumstances, owing to Walter's increasing blindness and the decline of the firm by which he was employed, in Holloway.In 1894 the family moved to St Albans in Hertfordshire, where Williams lived until his marriage in 1917.Educated at St Albans School, Williams was awarded a scholarship to University College London, but he left school in 1904 without attempting to gain a degree due to an inability to pay tuition fees.\nWilliams began work in 1904 in a Methodist bookroom. He was hired by the Oxford University Press (OUP) as a proofreading assistant in 1908 and quickly climbed to the position of editor. He continued to work at the OUP in various positions of increasing responsibility until his death in 1945. One of his greatest editorial achievements was the publication of the first major English-language edition of the works of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. His work was part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1924 Summer Olympics.Although chiefly remembered as a novelist, Williams also published poetry, works of literary criticism, theology, drama, history, biography, and a voluminous number of book reviews. Some of his best known novels are War in Heaven (1930), Descent into Hell (1937), and All Hallows' Eve (1945). T. S. Eliot, who wrote an introduction for the last of these, described Williams's novels as \"supernatural thrillers\" because they explore the sacramental intersection of the physical with the spiritual while also examining the ways in which power, even spiritual power, can corrupt as well as sanctify. All of Williams's fantasies, unlike those of J. R. R. Tolkien and most of those of C. S. Lewis, are set in the contemporary world. Williams has been described by Colin Manlove as one of the three main writers of \"Christian fantasy\" in the twentieth century (the other two being C.S. Lewis and T. F. Powys). More recent writers of fantasy novels with contemporary settings, notably Tim Powers, cite Williams as a model and inspiration. W. H. Auden, one of Williams's greatest admirers, reportedly re-read Williams's extraordinary and highly unconventional history of the church, The Descent of the Dove (1939), every year. Williams's study of Dante entitled The Figure of Beatrice (1944) was very highly regarded at its time of publication and continues to be consulted by Dante scholars today. His work inspired Dorothy L. Sayers to undertake her translation of The Divine Comedy. Williams, however, regarded his most important work to be his extremely dense and complex Arthurian poetry, of which two books were published, Taliessin through Logres (1938) and The Region of the Summer Stars (1944), and more remained unfinished at his death. Some of Williams's essays were collected and published posthumously in Image of the City and Other Essays (1958), edited by Anne Ridler.\nWilliams gathered many followers and disciples during his lifetime. He was, for a period, a member of the Salvator Mundi Temple of the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross. He met fellow Anglican Evelyn Underhill (who was affiliated with a similar group, the Order of the Golden Dawn) in 1937 and was later to write the introduction to her published Letters in 1943.When World War II broke out in 1939, Oxford University Press moved its offices from London to Oxford. Williams was reluctant to leave his beloved city, and his wife Florence refused to go. From the nearly 700 letters he wrote his wife during the war years a generous selection has been published; \"primarily\u2026 love letters,\" the editor calls them. But the move to Oxford did allow him to participate regularly in Lewis's literary society known as the Inklings. In this setting Williams was able to read (and improve) his final published novel, All Hallows' Eve, as well as to hear J. R. R. Tolkien read aloud to the group some of his early drafts of The Lord of the Rings. In addition to meeting in Lewis's rooms at Oxford, they also regularly met at The Eagle and Child pub in Oxford (better known by its nickname \"The Bird and Baby\"). During this time Williams also gave lectures at Oxford on John Milton, William Wordsworth, and other authors, and received an honorary M.A. degree. Williams is buried in Holywell Cemetery in Oxford: his headstone bears the word \"poet\", followed by the words \"Under the Mercy\", a phrase often used by Williams himself.\nPersonal life\nIn 1917 Williams married his first sweetheart, Florence Conway, following a long courtship during which he presented her with a sonnet sequence that would later become his first published book of poetry, The Silver Stair. Their son Michael was born in 1922.\nWilliams was an unswerving and devoted member of the Church of England, reputedly with a tolerance of the scepticism of others and a firm belief in the necessity of a \"doubting Thomas\" in any apostolic body.Although Williams attracted the attention and admiration of some of the most notable writers of his day, including T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden, his greatest admirer was probably C. S. Lewis, whose novel That Hideous Strength (1945) has been regarded as partially inspired by his acquaintance with both the man and his novels and poems. Williams came to know Lewis after reading Lewis's then-recently published study The Allegory of Love; he was so impressed he jotted down a letter of congratulation and dropped it in the mail. Coincidentally, Lewis had just finished reading Williams's novel The Place of the Lion and had written a similar note of congratulation. The letters crossed in the mail and led to an enduring and fruitful friendship.\n\nTheology\nWilliams developed the concept of co-inherence and gave rare consideration to the theology of romantic love. Falling in love for Williams was a form of mystical envisioning in which one saw the beloved as he or she was seen through the eyes of God. Co-inherence was a term used in Patristic theology to describe the relationship between the human and divine natures of Jesus Christ and the relationship between the persons of the blessed Trinity. Williams extended the term to include the ideal relationship between the individual parts of God's creation, including human beings. It is our mutual indwelling: Christ in us and we in Christ, interdependent.  It is also the web of interrelationships, social and economic and ecological, by which the social fabric and the natural world function. But especially for Williams, co-inherence is a way of talking about the Body of Christ and the communion of saints. For Williams, salvation was not a solitary affair: \"The thread of the love of God was strong enough to save you and all the others, but not strong enough to save you alone.\" He proposed an order, the Companions of the Co-inherence, who would practice substitution and exchange, living in love-in-God, truly bearing one another's burdens, being willing to sacrifice and to forgive, living from and for one another in Christ. According to Gunnar Urang, co-inherence is the focus of all Williams's novels.\nWorks\nFiction\nHe is writing that sort of book in which we begin by saying, let us suppose that this everyday world were at some one point invaded by the marvellous. \n1930: War in Heaven (London: Victor Gollancz)  \u2013 The Holy Grail surfaces in an obscure country parish and becomes variously a sacramental object to protect or a vessel of power to exploit.\n1930: Many Dimensions (London: Victor Gollancz)  \u2013 An evil antiquarian illegally purchases the fabled Stone of Suleiman (Williams uses this Muslim form rather than the more familiar King Solomon) from its Islamic guardian in Baghdad and returns to England to discover not only that the Stone can multiply itself infinitely without diminishing the original, but that it also allows its possessor to transcend the barriers of space and time.\n\"Et in Sempiternum Pereant,\" a short story first published in The London Mercury, December 1935, in which Lord Arglay (protagonist in Many Dimensions) has his life put at risk encountering a ghost on the path to damnation.\n1931: The Place of the Lion (London: Mundanus)  \u2013 Platonic archetypes begin to appear around an English country town, wreaking havoc and drawing to the surface the spiritual strengths and flaws of individual characters.\n1932: The Greater Trumps (London: Victor Gollancz)  \u2013 The original Tarot deck is used to unlock enormous metaphysical powers by allowing the possessors to see across space and time, create matter, and raise powerful natural storms.\n1933: Shadows of Ecstasy (London: Victor Gollancz)  \u2013 A humanistic adept has discovered that by focusing his energies inward he can extend his life almost indefinitely. He undertakes an experiment using African lore to die and resurrect his own body thereby assuring his immortality. His followers begin a revolutionary movement to supplant European civilisation. The first of Williams's novels to be written, though not the first published.\n1937: Descent into Hell (London: Faber & Faber) \u2013 Generally thought to be Williams's best novel, Descent deals with various forms of selfishness, and how the cycle of sin brings about the necessity for redemptive acts. In it, an academic becomes so far removed from the world that he fetishises a woman to the extent that his perversion takes the form of a succubus. Other characters include a doppelg\u00e4nger, the ghost of a suicidal Victorian labourer, and a playwright modelled in some ways on the author. Illustrates Williams's belief in the replacement of sin and substitutional love.\n1945: All Hallows' Eve (London: Faber & Faber) \u2013 Follows the fortunes of two women after death and their interactions with those they knew before, contrasting the results of action based either on selfishness or an accepting love.\n1970\u201372: The Noises That Weren\u2019t There.

His father moved the family to Chicago in 1889 where Starrett attended John Marshall High School.  \nStarrett landed a job as a cub reporter with the Chicago Inter-Ocean in 1905.  When that paper folded two years later he began working for the Chicago Daily News as a crime reporter, a feature writer, and finally a war correspondent in Mexico from 1914 to 1915. Starrett turned to writing mystery and supernatural fiction for pulp magazines during the 1920s and 1930s.\nIn 1920, he wrote a Sherlock Holmes pastiche entitled \"The Adventure of the Unique 'Hamlet'\". Starrett on at least one occasion said that the press-run was 100 copies, but on others claimed 200; a study of surviving copies by Randall Stock documents 110. This story involved the detective investigating a missing 1604 inscribed edition of Shakespeare's play 'Hamlet. \nStarrett's most famous work, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, was published in 1933.  Following that, Starrett wrote a book column, \"Books Alive,\" for The Chicago Tribune. He retired after 25 years of the column in 1967.  Starrett was one of the founders of The Hounds of the Baskerville (sic), a Chicago chapter of The Baker Street Irregulars.\nStarrett's horror\/fantasy stories were written primarily for the pulp magazine Weird Tales, and are collected in The Quick and the Dead, (Arkham House, 1965). His story \"Penelope,\" published in the May 1923 issue of Weird Tales, was also featured in the anthology The Moon Terror (1927) anonymously edited by Farnsworth Wright, and published by the magazine.\nStarrett's other writing included poetry, collected in Autolycus in Limbo, (Dutton, 1943), detective novels, such as Murder on 'B' Deck, (Doubleday, 1929, and others). \nHe had also created his own detective character, Chicago sleuth Jimmie Lavender, whose adventures usually first appeared in the pulp magazine Short Stories. The name Jimmie Lavender was that of an actual pitcher for the Chicago Cubs; Starrett wrote to ask the ball player for permission to use his name for a gentleman detective, which the pitcher granted. The stories are collected in The Case Book of Jimmie Lavender (Gold Label, 1944).\nStarrett was a major enthusiast of Welsh writer Arthur Machen and was instrumental in bringing Machen's work to an American audience for the first time.\nA complete edition of Starrett's works is being published by George Vanderburgh's Battered Silicon Dispatch Box, a print-on-demand publisher, with 22 of a projected 25 volumes already in print. A publication in the Vincent Starrett Memorial Library is Sherlock Alive, compiled and edited by Karen Murdock, and first printed in August of 2010.  Sherlock Alive is a collection of the Sherlockian references from Starrett's \"Books Alive\" column.\nHis influential weekly column \"Books Alive\" ran in Chicago Tribune for 25 years. He also wrote Best Loved Books of the 20th Century, a collection of 52 essays discussing popular works, published in 1955.\nFilm adaptations\nAmong his film adaptions his 1934 story Recipe for Murder first published in Redbook magazine in one installment was filmed as The Great Hotel Murder by Fox in 1935.\nSee also\nAdrian Conan DoyleReferences\nClute, John; John Grant (1997).

He liberated Japanese free verse from the grip of traditional rules, and he is considered the \"father of modern colloquial poetry in Japan\". He published many volumes of essays, literary and cultural criticism, and aphorisms over his long career. His unique style of verse expressed his doubts about existence, and his fears, ennui, and anger through the use of dark images and unambiguous wording.\n\nEarly life\nHagiwara Sakutar\u014d was born in Maebashi, Gunma Prefecture as the son of a prosperous local physician. He was interested in poetry, especially in the tanka format, from an early age, and started to write poetry much against his parents' wishes, drawing on the works of Akiko Yosano for inspiration. From his early teens, he started to contribute poems to literary magazines and had his tanka verse published in the literary journals Bunk\u014d, Shinsei and My\u014dj\u014d.\nHis mother bought him his first mandolin in the summer of 1903. After spending a futile five semesters as a freshman at two national universities, he dropped out of school, living for a period in Okayama and Kumamoto. In 1911, when his father was still trying to get him to enter college again, he began studying the mandolin in Tokyo, with the thought of becoming a professional musician. He later established a mandolin orchestra in his hometown Maebashi. His bohemian lifestyle was criticized by his childhood colleagues, and some of his early poems include spiteful remarks about his native Maebashi.\n\nLiterary career\nIn 1913, Hagiwara published five of his verses in Zamboa (\"Shaddock\"), a magazine edited by Kitahara Hakush\u016b, who became his mentor and friend. He also contributed verse to Maeda Yugure's Shiika (\"Poetry\") and Chij\u014d Junrei (\"Earth Pilgrimage\"), another journal created by Hakush\u016b. The following year, he joined Mur\u014d Saisei and the Christian minister Yamamura Boch\u014d in creating the Ningyo Shisha (\"Merman Poetry Group\"), dedicated to the study of music, poetry, and religion. The three writers called their literary magazine, Takuj\u014d Funsui (\"Tabletop Fountain\"), and published the first edition in 1915.\nIn 1915, Hagiwara attempted suicide because of his continued ill-health and alcoholism. However, in 1916, Hagiwara co-founded with Mur\u014d Saisei the literary magazine Kanj\u014d (\"Sentiment\"). The magazine was centered on the \"new style\" of modern Japanese poetry that Hagiwara was developing, in contrast to the highly intellectual and more traditionally structured poems in other contemporary literary magazines. In 1917, Hagiwara brought out his first free-verse collection, Tsuki ni Hoeru (\"Howling at the Moon\"), which had an introduction by Kitahara Hakush\u016b. The work created a sensation in literary circles. Hagiwara rejected the symbolism and use of unusual words, with consequent vagueness of Hakush\u016b and other contemporary poets in favor of precise wording which appealed rhythmically or musically to the ears. The work met with much critical acclaim, especially for its bleak style, conveying an attitude of pessimism and despair based on modern Western psychological concept of existential angst influenced by the philosophy of Nietzsche.\nHagiwara's second anthology, Aoneko (\"Blue Cat\") was published in 1923 to even greater acclaim and Tsuki ni Hoeru. The poems in this anthology incorporated concepts from Buddhism with the nihilism of Arthur Schopenhauer. Hagiwara subsequently published a number of other volumes of cultural and literary criticism. He was also a scholar of classical verse and published Shi no Genri (\"Principles of Poetry\", 1928). His critical study Ren'ai meika shu (\"A Collection of Best-Loved Love Poems\", 1931), shows that he had a deep appreciation for classical Japanese poetry, and Ky\u014dshu no shijin Yosa Buson (\"Yosa Buson\u2014Poet of Nostalgia\", 1936) reveals his respect for the haiku poet Buson, who advocated a return to the 17th century rules of Bash\u014d.\nHy\u014dt\u014d (\"Icy Island\") published in 1934 was Hagiwara's last major anthology of poetry. He abandoned the use of both free verse and colloquial Japanese, and returned to a more traditional structure with a realistic content. The poems are occasionally autobiographical, and exhibit a sense of despair and loneliness. The work received only mixed reviews. For most of his life, Hagiwara relied on his wealthy family for financial support. However, he taught at Meiji University from 1934 until his death in 1942.\n\nDeath\nAfter more than six months of struggle with what appeared to be lung cancer but which doctors diagnosed as acute pneumonia, he died in May 1942\u2014not quite six months short of his 56th birthday. His grave is at the temple of Jujun-ji, in his native Maebashi.\n\nPersonal life\nHagiwara married Ueda Ineko in 1919; they had two daughters, Y\u014dko (1920\u20132005), also a writer, and Akirako (b. 1922). Ineko deserted her family for a younger man in June 1929 and ran off to Hokkaid\u014d and Sakutar\u014d formally divorced her in October.He married again in 1938 to Otani Mitsuko, but after only eighteen months Sakutar\u014d's mother\u2014who had never registered the marriage in the family register (koseki)\u2014drove her away.\n\nSee also\nJapanese literature\nList of Japanese authorsReferences and reading\nHagiwara, Sakutaro.

Dell has been called \"one of the most flamboyant, versatile and influential American Men of Letters of the first third of the 20th Century.\" In Chicago, he was editor of the nationally syndicated Friday Literary Review. As editor and critic, Dell's influence is seen in the work of many major American writers from the first half of the 20th century. A lifelong poet, he was also a best-selling author, as well as a playwright whose hit Broadway comedy, Little Accident (1928), was made into a Hollywood movie.Dell wrote extensively on controversial social issues of the early 20th century, and played a major part in the political and social movements originating in New York City's Greenwich Village during the 1910s & 1920s. As editor of left-wing magazine The Masses, Dell was twice put on trial for publishing subversive literature.\n\nBiography\nEarly life and career\nDell was born in Barry, Illinois, on June 28, 1887 to Anthony Dell, a Civil War veteran and unsuccessful butcher, and Kate Crone, a home maker. Dell spent his childhood in poverty, with his family moving often. He lived in Quincy, Illinois, for a large portion of his childhood. Encouraged by his mother, a former school teacher, Dell became a voracious reader, spending much of his time at Quincy's local library.\nIn 1903 Dell moved with his family to Davenport, Iowa, which was then a liberal and cosmopolitan port city and center of trade with a thriving literary and intellectual scene. Initially attending Davenport High School, Dell did not return to school after the summer of 1904, instead becoming a reporter at a local paper. Dell also became an active socialist and associated with other local writers to form what would be called the 'Davenport group'. While in Davenport, Dell also began publishing poetry, first in local papers, then in national periodicals. By the time Dell left Davenport for Chicago in 1908, he had escaped blue-collar life to emerge as a promising young professional writer and intellectual. It was also in Davenport that Dell met Marilla Waite Freeman, the director of the library. Dell is quoted as saying that he \"caught a glimpse of mountaintops\" through Freeman's inspiration, and he dedicated a number of poems and novels to her. Freeman also served as the model for the librarian character, Helen Raymond, in Moon-Calf.\nIn Chicago Dell became editor and book reviewer for of the Chicago Evening Post's nationally distributed Friday Literary Review, the \"leading organ of literary modernism in America at the time.\" Dell used his position as editor to introduce many Americans to modernist literature and promote the work of many Chicago writers, including Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson, and Carl Sandburg. Dell's further influence as a critic can be seen in the work of many major American writers from the first half of the 20th century.\n\nGreenwich Village\nRelocating to New York City in 1913, Dell became a leader of the pre-war bohemian community in Greenwich Village and managing editor of Max Eastman's radical magazine The Masses. Following the passing of the Espionage Act of 1917, the government officially labeled the magazine \"treasonable material\" in August of that year and issued charges against its staff for \"unlawfully and willfully\u2026 obstruct[ing] the recruiting and enlistment of the United States\" military. The \"conspirators\" faced fines up to 10,000 dollars and twenty years imprisonment. After deliberating for three days, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision. The jurors seeking to convict the defendants blamed one juror for being unable to conform to the majority opinion, as he was also a socialist. Not only did the other eleven jurors demand that the prosecutor levy charges against the lone juror, they attempted to drag the socialist supporter out into the street and lynch him. The Judge, given the uproar, declared a mistrial. A second trial also resulted in a deadlocked jury.\nDell joined fellow Davenporters Susan Glaspell and George Cram Cook as a member of the Provincetown Players and his play King Arthur's Socks was the first performed by that historic theater group.\n\nLater life & career\nFollowing the war, Dell turned to fiction and his first novel, the bildungsroman (or coming-of-age) Moon-Calf, became a best seller. It was an early book for the publisher Alfred A. Knopf and published at a time when many mid-western writers were writing about small-town life; Sinclair Lewis's book Main Street was published within days of Moon-Calf. By 1920 Moon-Calf had sold 38,500 copies and went through eleven printings.This was followed by several other novels with limited success. His autobiographical memoir, Homecoming, is a striking eyewitness view of the social and artistic-bohemian history of the midwest.  Dell continued to publish both fiction and non-fiction until the end of his life.\nDell joined the WPA and U.S. Information Service in 1935 from which he retired following World War II. He married Beatrice Marie, and had two sons. One son, Christopher Dell, became a writer as well. He married and had two daughters: Jerri Dell who is the current literary executor and archivist of the Dell Collection, and Kathryn Dell Kaufman; then he divorced and remarried Kate Kane. With Kate he had a daughter, Mia Dell, who is married and has three children.\nFloyd Dell died in Bethesda, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., on July 23, 1969.\nIn 2015, he was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.\nPartial bibliography\nNovels\n\nNon-fiction\n\n\nEssays\n\n\nPlays\n\n\nFurther reading\nDell, Floyd; Homecoming: An Autobiography, New York Farrar & Rinehart Incorporated (1933).\nClayton, Douglas; Floyd Dell: The Life and Times of an American Rebel, (Chicago: Ivan R, Dee, 1994).\nHart, John E; Floyd Dell, Twayne Publishers Inc (New York: 1971).\nDell, Jerri; Blood Too Bright: Floyd Dell Remembers Edna St. Vincent Millay, Glenmere Press (2017).References\nExternal links\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Floyd Dell\nFloyd Dell: A Respectable Radical\nFloyd Dell in Iowa\nBackwards Glance: Feminism for Men in 1914\nWorks by Floyd Dell at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by Floyd Dell at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \nWorks by or about Floyd Dell at Internet Archive\nFloyd Dell Papers and Miriam Gurko-Floyd Dell Papers at the Newberry Library\n\n","116":"Pierre Jean Jouve (11 October 1887 \u2013 8 January 1976) was a French writer, novelist and poet. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times. In 1966 he was awarded the Grand Prix de Po\u00e9sie by the French Academy.Born and raised in Arras, as a teenager Jouve read Rimbaud, Mallarm\u00e9, and Baudelaire and began to write poetry of his own. In 1906, he and his sister Madeleine, together with their close family friends the Charpentiers, founded the literary magazine Le Bandeau d'Or. At that time, Jouve drew close to the Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil, a literary and utopian movement based outside Paris. In 1910 he married Andr\u00e9e Charpentier, and the couple moved to Poitiers, where Andr\u00e9e took a position as a teacher and Pierre sold player pianos. During World War One he served as an orderly in the hospital at Poitiers. A militant pacifist, in 1915 he and Andr\u00e9e left France for Switzerland, where he became close to the novelist Romain Rolland and continued to serve as an orderly.In the 1920s, Jouve fell in love with Blanche Reverchon, a psychiatrist and the first translator of Sigmund Freud's work into French; later, at Freud's urging, she established her own practice as a psychoanalyst in Paris.. She and Jouve were married in 1925. In 1928, after undergoing analysis himself, Jouve renounced all of his previously published work. His subsequent writing was heavily influenced by his reading of Freud and deeply engaged with themes of sexuality and guilt. In later life, he and Blanche were at the center of a circle of writers and artists that included Balthus, Philippe Roman, David Gascoyne, and Henry Bauchaud. Vociferously anti-fascist, Jouve was along with Louis Aragon one of the chief poets of the French resistance.\nWorks\nOriginal works in French\nPaulina 1880, 1925\nVagadu, 1931\nNoces, 1931\nSueur de sang, 1935\nMati\u00e8re c\u00e9leste, 1937\nLa Vierge de Paris, 1946\nTombeau de Baudelaire, 1958Works translated into English\nAn Idiom of Night, selected and translated by Keith Bosley (Swallow Press 1968)\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne, trans.

S. Van Dine (also styled S.S. Van Dine) is the pseudonym used by American art critic Willard Huntington Wright (October 15, 1888 \u2013 April 11, 1939) when he wrote detective novels. Wright was an important figure in avant-garde cultural circles in pre-World War I New York, and under the pseudonym (which he originally used to conceal his identity) he created the immensely popular fictional detective Philo Vance, a sleuth and aesthete who first appeared in books in the 1920s, then in films and on the radio.\n\nEarly life\nWillard Huntington Wright was born to Archibald Davenport Wright and Annie Van Vranken Wright on October 15, 1888, in Charlottesville, Virginia. His younger brother, Stanton Macdonald-Wright, became a respected painter, one of the first American abstract artists, and co-founder (with Morgan Russell) of the school of modern art known as \"Synchromism\". Willard and Stanton were raised in Santa Monica, California, where their father owned a hotel. Willard, a largely self-taught writer, attended St. Vincent College, Pomona College, and Harvard University without graduating. In 1907, he married Katharine Belle Boynton of Seattle, Washington; they had one child, Beverley. He abandoned Katherine and Beverley early in their marriage. Katharine was granted a divorce in October 1930. he married for a second time in October 1930. His second wife was Eleanor Rulapaugh, known professionally as Claire De Lisle, a portrait painter and socialite.\nWriting career\nAt age 21, Wright began his professional writing career as literary editor of the Los Angeles Times, where \u2013 describing himself as \"'Esthetic expert and psychological shark\" \u2013 he was known for his scathing book reviews and irreverent opinions. He was particularly caustic about romance and detective fiction. His friend and mentor H.L. Mencken was an early inspiration. Other important literary influences included Oscar Wilde and Ambrose Bierce. Wright was an advocate of the naturalism of Theodore Dreiser, and Wright's own novel, The Man of Promise (1916), was written in a similar style.\nIn 1909, Wright wrote a perceptive profile of Edgar Allan Poe for the Los Angeles Times. Wright moved to New York City in 1911. He published realist fiction as editor of the New York literary magazine The Smart Set, from 1912 to 1914, a job he attained with Mencken's help. He was fired from that position when the magazine's conservative owner felt that Wright was intentionally provoking their middle-class readership with his interest in unconventional and often sexually explicit fiction. In his two-year tenure, Wright published short stories by Gabriele D'Annunzio, Floyd Dell, Ford Madox Ford, D.H. Lawrence, and George Moore; a play by Joseph Conrad; and poems by Ezra Pound and William Butler Yeats.\nIn 1913, he visited Paris and Munich, seeing Impressionist and Synchromist works of art. He wrote an article about the art, Impressionism to Synchromism, December 1913, published in New York magazine, which brought the abstract art to public attention in the US.Wright's energies were devoted to numerous projects, reflecting his wide range of interests. His book What Nietzsche Taught appeared in 1915. An attempt to popularize the German philosopher with skeptical American audiences, it described and commented on all of Nietzsche's books and provided quotations from each work. Wright continued to write short stories in this period; in 2012 Brooks Hefner revealed heretofore unknown short stories that featured an intellectual criminal, written by Wright under a pseudonym several years before his adoption of the Van Dine pseudonym.Wright was, however, most respected in intellectual circles for his writing about art. In Modern Painting: Its Tendency and Meaning (secretly co-authored in 1915 with his brother Stanton), he surveyed the important art movements of the last hundred years from Manet to Cubism, praised the largely unknown work of C\u00e9zanne, and predicted a coming era in which an art of color abstraction would replace realism. Admired by people like Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O'Keeffe, Wright became under his brother's tutelage one of the most progressive (and belligerently opinionated) art critics of the time and helped to organize several shows, including the \"Forum Exhibition of Modern American Painters\", that brought the most advanced new painters to the attention of audiences on both coasts. He also published a work of aesthetic philosophy, The Creative Will (1916), that O'Keeffe and William Faulkner both regarded as a meaningful influence on their thinking about artistic identity.In 1917, Wright published Misinforming a Nation, in which he mounted a blistering attack on alleged inaccuracies and British biases in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition. A Germanophile, Wright did not support America's decision to join the Allied cause in World War I, and he was blackballed from journalism for more than two years after an overzealous secretary (erroneously) accused him of spying for Germany, an episode that became a much-publicized scandal in New York in November 1917. Though cleared, his favourable view of Prussian militarism cost him his friendships with Mencken and Dreiser. In 1929, at the height of his fame as 'Philo Vance', he was appointed Police Commissioner of Bradley Beach, New Jersey. After suffering a nervous breakdown and the beginning of a long-term dependence on drugs, Wright retreated to California, where he attempted to make a living as a newspaper columnist in San Francisco.. Contrary to what is stated in some sources, Wright did write a biography of the poet Richard Hovey and it was announced for publication in Spring 1914. In 1929, Wright stated that \"It is true that at one time I was working on a book relating to Richard Hovey and his friends but Mrs Hovey died before the book went to press, and it has never been published\"; that remains the case.\n\nJournalism and reviews\nEdgar Allan Poe: His Art, Accomplishments, Influence.

Reprinted: Southwest News, 19 June 1924Detective fiction\nReturning to New York in 1920, Wright took any freelance work that came his way but lived a restless, impoverished existence and, in his displays of temper and anxiety, alienated many of his old friends. By 1923, he was seriously ill, the result of a breakdown from overwork, he claimed, but in reality the consequence of his secret cocaine addiction, according to John Loughery's biography Alias S.S. Van Dine. Confined to bed for a prolonged period of recovery, he began in frustration and boredom reading hundreds of volumes of crime and detection. As a direct result of this exhaustive study, he wrote a seminal essay, published in 1926, which explored the history, traditions and conventions of detective fiction as an art form.  Wright also decided to try his own hand at detective fiction and approached Maxwell Perkins, the famous Scribner's editor whom he had known at Harvard, with an outline for a trilogy that would feature an affluent, snobbish amateur sleuth, a Jazz Age Manhattan setting, and lively topical references. In 1926, the first Philo Vance book, The Benson Murder Case, was published under the pseudonym \"S.S. Van Dine\". Within two years, following the publication of The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, Wright was one of the best-selling authors in the United States.Frankly embarrassed by his turn from intellectual pursuits to mass market fiction, Wright never wanted to publish under his own name. He took his pseudonym from the abbreviation of \"steamship\" and from Van Dine, which he claimed was an old family name. According to Loughery, however, \"there are no Van Dines evident in the family tree\" (p.\u00a0176). He went on to write twelve mysteries in total, though their author's identity was unmasked by 1928. The first few books about the distinctive Philo Vance (who shared with his creator a love of art and a disdain for the common touch) were so popular that Wright became wealthy for the first time in his life. His readership was diverse and worldwide. David Shavit's study of World War II POW reading habits revealed that Vance was one of the favorite detectives among officer POWs. However, according to critic Julian Symons:\n[Van Dine's] fate is curiously foreshadowed in that of Stanford West, the hero of his only [non-crime] novel, who sells out by abandoning the unpopular work in which he searched for \"a sound foundation of culture and aristocracy\" and becoming a successful novelist. The title of an article Wright penned at the height of his fame, \"I Used to be a Highbrow but Look at Me Now,\" reflects both his pleasure in his newfound fame and his regret that he would never again be regarded as a serious writer.\nWright's later books declined in both quality and popularity. The reading public's tastes changed, and the \"hard-boiled\" school of detective fiction became the dominant style in the 1930s. The new mood was captured by Ogden Nash in his brief verse:\n\n\nPhilo Vance and Sam Spade occupy different aesthetic universes. Wright continued to make money, though, and by the end of the decade, he saw himself caught in a trap from which he could not escape: in the midst of the Depression, he could not return to literary journalism and art criticism which paid very little, now that he and his wife were accustomed to an extravagant way of life, and yet he no longer believed in the kind of novels he was producing each year in order to maintain that way of life.\nMysteries\nHughes, Rupert, Samuel Hopkins Adams, Anthony Abbot, Rita Weiman, S.

Novel by John Riddell (Corey Ford), 1939Study of detective fiction\nIn addition to his success as a writer of fiction, Wright's lengthy introduction and notes to the anthology The World's Great Detective Stories (1927) are important in the history of the critical study of detective fiction. Although dated by the passage of time, this essay is still a core around which many other such commentaries have been constructed. He also wrote an article, \"Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories\", in 1928 for The American Magazine It has been frequently reprinted and compared to \"Knox's (Ten) Commandments\" by Ronald Knox.\nShort film series\nWright wrote a series of scenarios for Warner Brothers film studio in the early 1930s. These were used as the basis for a series of 12 two-reel \"murder mystery\" films, each approximately 20 minutes long, that were released in 1931 - 1932. Of these, The Skull Murder Mystery shows Wright's vigorous plot construction. It is also notable for its non-stereotypical treatment of Chinese characters, something quite unusual in its day.Donald Meek (as Dr. Crabtree) and John Hamilton (as Inspector Carr) were featured players, with Joseph Henabery directing. Three titles (The Wall Street Mystery, The Studio Murder Mystery, and the Trans-Atlantic Murder Mystery) have been released on DVD as extras on Forbidden Hollywood Collection Volume 3 (Warner). The titles are followed by dates reviewed by Film Daily:\nThe Clyde Mystery (September 27, 1931). This starred Donald Meek and Helen Flint.\nThe Wall Street Mystery (November 4, 1931)\nThe Week End Mystery (December 6, 1931).

Advertised as The Sideshow Mystery\nThe Campus Mystery (July 2, 1932). This is the only title in the series without Donald Meek.\nThe Crane Poison Case (July 9, 1932)\nThe Trans-Atlantic Murder Mystery (August 31, 1932). Advertised as The Transatlantic MysteryAs far as it is known, none of Van Dine's screen treatments has been published in book form, and none of the manuscripts survive. Short films were popular then, and Hollywood made hundreds of them during the studio era. Except for a handful of famous comedies, short films are not often discussed in more recent film reference books like features and animated cartoons often are.\nOn 13 September 1932, a $500,000 plagiarism suit was filed against Van Dine and the Vitaphone Film Company by Arlo Channing Edington and Carmen Ballen Edington who charged that their novel, The Studio Murder Mystery, which had been filmed by Paramount in 1929, had been \"'lifted' - title, plot and incident\"  and produced by the film company, credited to Van Dine. The outcome of the suit is unknown.\n\nLate career and death\nFrom a monetary perspective, Wright was fortunate in his experiences with Hollywood, and he was lionized on his visits to the movie capital. All but two of his novels were made into feature-length films, and the role of Philo Vance was played in different film versions by stars as popular as William Powell (before his Nick Charles period), Basil Rathbone, and Edmund Lowe. Louise Brooks (in The Canary Murder Case), Jean Arthur (in The Green Murder Case), and Rosalind Russell (in The Casino Murder Case) appeared in the S.S. Van Dine movies.On April 11, 1939, at age 50, Wright died in New York of a heart condition exacerbated by excessive drinking, a year after the publication of an unpopular experimental novel that incorporated one of the biggest stars in radio comedy, The Gracie Allen Murder Case. He left behind a complete novelette-length story that was intended as a film vehicle for Sonja Henie and was published posthumously as The Winter Murder Case. Max Perkins generously referred to Wright at the time of Wright's death as a \"gallant, gentle man\" who had been tormented by the pressures of a market-driven age.  His portrait, painted by his brother in 1914, hangs in the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.\nReferences\nBibliography\nDolmetsch, Carl, ed. (1966).

In 1966 he was awarded the Grand Prix de Po\u00e9sie by the French Academy.Born and raised in Arras, as a teenager Jouve read Rimbaud, Mallarm\u00e9, and Baudelaire and began to write poetry of his own. In 1906, he and his sister Madeleine, together with their close family friends the Charpentiers, founded the literary magazine Le Bandeau d'Or. At that time, Jouve drew close to the Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil, a literary and utopian movement based outside Paris. In 1910 he married Andr\u00e9e Charpentier, and the couple moved to Poitiers, where Andr\u00e9e took a position as a teacher and Pierre sold player pianos. During World War One he served as an orderly in the hospital at Poitiers. A militant pacifist, in 1915 he and Andr\u00e9e left France for Switzerland, where he became close to the novelist Romain Rolland and continued to serve as an orderly.In the 1920s, Jouve fell in love with Blanche Reverchon, a psychiatrist and the first translator of Sigmund Freud's work into French; later, at Freud's urging, she established her own practice as a psychoanalyst in Paris.. She and Jouve were married in 1925. In 1928, after undergoing analysis himself, Jouve renounced all of his previously published work. His subsequent writing was heavily influenced by his reading of Freud and deeply engaged with themes of sexuality and guilt. In later life, he and Blanche were at the center of a circle of writers and artists that included Balthus, Philippe Roman, David Gascoyne, and Henry Bauchaud. Vociferously anti-fascist, Jouve was along with Louis Aragon one of the chief poets of the French resistance.\nWorks\nOriginal works in French\nPaulina 1880, 1925\nVagadu, 1931\nNoces, 1931\nSueur de sang, 1935\nMati\u00e8re c\u00e9leste, 1937\nLa Vierge de Paris, 1946\nTombeau de Baudelaire, 1958Works translated into English\nAn Idiom of Night, selected and translated by Keith Bosley (Swallow Press 1968)\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne, trans.

His father, Abe Taizo, was the founder of Meiji Life Insurance Company. In 1891 the family moved to Matsuzaka-cho in Shiba Ward of Tokyo. Minakami attended Kei\u014d High School and played on the school's baseball club. While attending Keio University, he was inspired by the works of Ky\u014dka Izumi and by a newly appointed professor, Kaf\u016b Nagai, who was also the founder of the literary magazine Mita Bungaku, launched in 1910. While at Kei\u014d University, Minakami developed a friendship with the playwright, script writer, and director of the Bungakuza Theater, Mantar\u014d Kubota.\n\nLiterary career\nWhile still a student at Keio University he began his literary career by contributing poems and short stories to Mita Bungaku and to the mainstream literary magazine Subaru. He established his own literary circle, Rei-no-kai, by gathering his aspiring writer friends at his home. His debut story, Yamanote no Ko (\"Child from Yamanote\") was the story of these gatherings, and was published in 1911 in Mita Bungaku. His choice of a pen-name came from a character in one of Izumi Kyoka's stories.\nAfter a period overseas, studying economics in the United States, and touring 16 countries around the world, Minakami returned to Japan in 1916 to accept a position in his father's insurance company. However, he did not give up his literary aspirations, and this job provided him with an insight into the lives of white-collar workers, albeit from the rather lofty position of director of one of Japan's largest insurance companies.\nMinakami wrote numerous novels in the 1920s and 1930s depicting the lives of common, urban people. His works include a novel Osaka no yado (\"An Inn in Osaka\", 1925\u20131926) and Kaigara Tsuih\u014d  (1918\u20131940), a collection of essays.\nAfter Keio University dropped its financial support for Mita Bungaku literary magazine in 1925, he (along with Kubota Mantaro) contributed greatly to its re-launch and supported it throughout the 1930s.\nMinakami continued to enjoy baseball even after he became a writer by arranging games between the Mita Bungaku amateur baseball team and a team led by rival author Ton Satomi.\nMinakami died of a brain hemorrhage in 1940. His grave is at the Tama Reien, in Fuch\u016b, Tokyo.\n\nExternal links\ne-texts of Minakami's works at Aozora BunkoSee also\nJapanese literature\nList of Japanese authors\n\n\n","120":"Adrien Bertrand (4 August 1888, Nyons \u2013 18 November 1917) was a French novelist whose short career was punctuated by a series of striking surrealist anti-war novels, written as Bertrand lay dying from complications involved in a wound he suffered whilst serving with the French Army in the First World War.\n\nBiography\nBertrand was born in 1888 in Nyons, Dr\u00f4me, and after attending his local school, he departed for Paris, where he worked as a journalist on a number of papers, including Paris-Midi and L'Homme libre. During this period, he also began a literary magazine named Les Chim\u00e9res, which he used as a vehicle to publicise his socialist ideas and surrealist poetry, as well as give a voice to people of a like mind. Bertrand was a confirmed pacifist and just short of his 26th birthday when the First World War began, but nonetheless joined the French Army immediately, being given a position in the cavalry. For the next three months he was continuously engaged in the Battle of the Frontiers against the German Army and made a name for himself in his unit with some daring exploits.\nLate in October 1914 a German shell burst amongst his unit, and a slice of shrapnel tore into Bertrand's chest, causing irreparable damage to his lungs. Bertrand survived the immediate aftermath of the wound, and was eventually transferred to the lowest grade of military hospital, into what was effectively a hospice. Doctors had informed him that his lungs would never work properly again, he was permanently bedridden and that death was inevitable in his condition. Faced with long periods of enforced bed rest, Bertrand returned to his writing and completed two works before he finally succumbed to his wounds over three years after he received them.\n\nCareer\nIn 1916, Bertrand was awarded the Prix Goncourt for his novel L'Appel du sol about a group of soldiers thrust into the war Bertrand himself had fought, during which they experience horrors none ever expected to just a few weeks before. These soldiers study the motives behind their march to war, representing all France in their make-up and ideals, but also unpicking the reasons behind the French will to fight and the destructive nature of blind patriotism.\nHis second work was named L'Orage sur le jardin de Candide, and was a collection of four short stories, collected and finished in the weeks before his death, and reflecting that ominous state of affairs very strongly. They are frequently surreal and often heavily introspective, perhaps reflecting the world that Bertrand found himself in.\nThe first story is entitled \"Carnet de campagne d'un soldat des arme\u00e9s de la R\u00e9publique\", and purports to be the memoirs of one Auguste Rousset, a soldier in the French Army during the French Revolutionary War. His character is largely based on Bertrand himself, and the tale is semi-autobiographical in many of the experiences Rousset endures. This highlighted one of Bertrand's favourite topics, the cyclical nature of history, or as he put it, History repeats itself.\nThe second story is set in Roman times, named \"L'Illusion du pr\u00e9fet Mucius\", and is based on a story by Tacitus. In the tale, the main character Mucius, a Roman Christian, attempts to preach the Gospel amongst the Germani tribes, resulting in a battle very similar in tone to that of the Battle of the Marne, where Bertrand was wounded.\nThe third story is the most bizarre, named \"De la pluie qui surprit Candide en son jardin et d'un entretien qu'il eut avec plusieurs personnages\", it tells of a meeting in the garden of Candide between Achilles, Don Quixote, Faust, Mr Pickwick and the lead character of Bertrand's first novel L'Appel du sol. These fictional characters then discuss the previous work by Bertrand, and attempt to shape an ideal future for the war-ravaged world.\nThe fourth story, \"Les Animaux sous la tourmente\", is a more mainstream piece, in which several fables of La Fontaine are reworked to question the pomposity and arrogance of those in the French literary elite, especially Romain Rolland, who believed that art and literature should rise above the war rather than compromise themselves for it.\nIn addition to these more famous pieces, he also wrote a large body of poems and short stories as well as a short playscript. Most of these works were posthumously published .\n\nWorks\n1908 Catulle Mend\u00e8s, non-fiction\n1910 E.

He attended the Gakush\u016bin Peers' School, and went on to graduate from Tokyo Imperial University. Through his school connections, he made the acquaintance of Mushanokoji Saneatsu and Shiga Naoya, and he contributed works to the Shirakaba (\"White Birch\") literary journal. He is considered a typical spokesman for the humanistic philosophy of the Shirakaba school.\nPublication of Shirakaba was suspended in 1923 after the Great Kant\u014d earthquake, but Nagayo and Mushanokoji collaborated to bring out a new literary magazine, Fuji, the same year. As a literary critic for Fuji, Nagayo railed against the proletarian literature movement of the pre-war period.\nHis major works include the plays Kou to Ryuho (1916\u20131917), Indara no ko (\"Child of Indra\", 1921), and the historical novel Takezawa sensei to iu hito (1924\u201325).\nHe is best known in the West for his screenplay Seido no Kirisuto (\"Christ in Bronze\"), a story about religious persecution in Edo period Japan, which was one of the entries in competition at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nReferences\nMortimer, Maya.

Van Dine) is the pseudonym used by American art critic Willard Huntington Wright (October 15, 1888 \u2013 April 11, 1939) when he wrote detective novels. Wright was an important figure in avant-garde cultural circles in pre-World War I New York, and under the pseudonym (which he originally used to conceal his identity) he created the immensely popular fictional detective Philo Vance, a sleuth and aesthete who first appeared in books in the 1920s, then in films and on the radio.\n\nEarly life\nWillard Huntington Wright was born to Archibald Davenport Wright and Annie Van Vranken Wright on October 15, 1888, in Charlottesville, Virginia. His younger brother, Stanton Macdonald-Wright, became a respected painter, one of the first American abstract artists, and co-founder (with Morgan Russell) of the school of modern art known as \"Synchromism\". Willard and Stanton were raised in Santa Monica, California, where their father owned a hotel. Willard, a largely self-taught writer, attended St. Vincent College, Pomona College, and Harvard University without graduating. In 1907, he married Katharine Belle Boynton of Seattle, Washington; they had one child, Beverley. He abandoned Katherine and Beverley early in their marriage. Katharine was granted a divorce in October 1930. he married for a second time in October 1930. His second wife was Eleanor Rulapaugh, known professionally as Claire De Lisle, a portrait painter and socialite.\nWriting career\nAt age 21, Wright began his professional writing career as literary editor of the Los Angeles Times, where \u2013 describing himself as \"'Esthetic expert and psychological shark\" \u2013 he was known for his scathing book reviews and irreverent opinions. He was particularly caustic about romance and detective fiction. His friend and mentor H.L. Mencken was an early inspiration. Other important literary influences included Oscar Wilde and Ambrose Bierce. Wright was an advocate of the naturalism of Theodore Dreiser, and Wright's own novel, The Man of Promise (1916), was written in a similar style.\nIn 1909, Wright wrote a perceptive profile of Edgar Allan Poe for the Los Angeles Times. Wright moved to New York City in 1911. He published realist fiction as editor of the New York literary magazine The Smart Set, from 1912 to 1914, a job he attained with Mencken's help. He was fired from that position when the magazine's conservative owner felt that Wright was intentionally provoking their middle-class readership with his interest in unconventional and often sexually explicit fiction. In his two-year tenure, Wright published short stories by Gabriele D'Annunzio, Floyd Dell, Ford Madox Ford, D.H. Lawrence, and George Moore; a play by Joseph Conrad; and poems by Ezra Pound and William Butler Yeats.\nIn 1913, he visited Paris and Munich, seeing Impressionist and Synchromist works of art. He wrote an article about the art, Impressionism to Synchromism, December 1913, published in New York magazine, which brought the abstract art to public attention in the US.Wright's energies were devoted to numerous projects, reflecting his wide range of interests. His book What Nietzsche Taught appeared in 1915. An attempt to popularize the German philosopher with skeptical American audiences, it described and commented on all of Nietzsche's books and provided quotations from each work. Wright continued to write short stories in this period; in 2012 Brooks Hefner revealed heretofore unknown short stories that featured an intellectual criminal, written by Wright under a pseudonym several years before his adoption of the Van Dine pseudonym.Wright was, however, most respected in intellectual circles for his writing about art. In Modern Painting: Its Tendency and Meaning (secretly co-authored in 1915 with his brother Stanton), he surveyed the important art movements of the last hundred years from Manet to Cubism, praised the largely unknown work of C\u00e9zanne, and predicted a coming era in which an art of color abstraction would replace realism. Admired by people like Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O'Keeffe, Wright became under his brother's tutelage one of the most progressive (and belligerently opinionated) art critics of the time and helped to organize several shows, including the \"Forum Exhibition of Modern American Painters\", that brought the most advanced new painters to the attention of audiences on both coasts. He also published a work of aesthetic philosophy, The Creative Will (1916), that O'Keeffe and William Faulkner both regarded as a meaningful influence on their thinking about artistic identity.In 1917, Wright published Misinforming a Nation, in which he mounted a blistering attack on alleged inaccuracies and British biases in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition. A Germanophile, Wright did not support America's decision to join the Allied cause in World War I, and he was blackballed from journalism for more than two years after an overzealous secretary (erroneously) accused him of spying for Germany, an episode that became a much-publicized scandal in New York in November 1917. Though cleared, his favourable view of Prussian militarism cost him his friendships with Mencken and Dreiser. In 1929, at the height of his fame as 'Philo Vance', he was appointed Police Commissioner of Bradley Beach, New Jersey. After suffering a nervous breakdown and the beginning of a long-term dependence on drugs, Wright retreated to California, where he attempted to make a living as a newspaper columnist in San Francisco.. Contrary to what is stated in some sources, Wright did write a biography of the poet Richard Hovey and it was announced for publication in Spring 1914. In 1929, Wright stated that \"It is true that at one time I was working on a book relating to Richard Hovey and his friends but Mrs Hovey died before the book went to press, and it has never been published\"; that remains the case.\n\nJournalism and reviews\nEdgar Allan Poe: His Art, Accomplishments, Influence.

By 1923, he was seriously ill, the result of a breakdown from overwork, he claimed, but in reality the consequence of his secret cocaine addiction, according to John Loughery's biography Alias S.S. Van Dine. Confined to bed for a prolonged period of recovery, he began in frustration and boredom reading hundreds of volumes of crime and detection. As a direct result of this exhaustive study, he wrote a seminal essay, published in 1926, which explored the history, traditions and conventions of detective fiction as an art form.  Wright also decided to try his own hand at detective fiction and approached Maxwell Perkins, the famous Scribner's editor whom he had known at Harvard, with an outline for a trilogy that would feature an affluent, snobbish amateur sleuth, a Jazz Age Manhattan setting, and lively topical references. In 1926, the first Philo Vance book, The Benson Murder Case, was published under the pseudonym \"S.S. Van Dine\". Within two years, following the publication of The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, Wright was one of the best-selling authors in the United States.Frankly embarrassed by his turn from intellectual pursuits to mass market fiction, Wright never wanted to publish under his own name. He took his pseudonym from the abbreviation of \"steamship\" and from Van Dine, which he claimed was an old family name. According to Loughery, however, \"there are no Van Dines evident in the family tree\" (p.\u00a0176). He went on to write twelve mysteries in total, though their author's identity was unmasked by 1928. The first few books about the distinctive Philo Vance (who shared with his creator a love of art and a disdain for the common touch) were so popular that Wright became wealthy for the first time in his life. His readership was diverse and worldwide. David Shavit's study of World War II POW reading habits revealed that Vance was one of the favorite detectives among officer POWs. However, according to critic Julian Symons:\n[Van Dine's] fate is curiously foreshadowed in that of Stanford West, the hero of his only [non-crime] novel, who sells out by abandoning the unpopular work in which he searched for \"a sound foundation of culture and aristocracy\" and becoming a successful novelist. The title of an article Wright penned at the height of his fame, \"I Used to be a Highbrow but Look at Me Now,\" reflects both his pleasure in his newfound fame and his regret that he would never again be regarded as a serious writer.\nWright's later books declined in both quality and popularity. The reading public's tastes changed, and the \"hard-boiled\" school of detective fiction became the dominant style in the 1930s. The new mood was captured by Ogden Nash in his brief verse:\n\n\nPhilo Vance and Sam Spade occupy different aesthetic universes. Wright continued to make money, though, and by the end of the decade, he saw himself caught in a trap from which he could not escape: in the midst of the Depression, he could not return to literary journalism and art criticism which paid very little, now that he and his wife were accustomed to an extravagant way of life, and yet he no longer believed in the kind of novels he was producing each year in order to maintain that way of life.\nMysteries\nHughes, Rupert, Samuel Hopkins Adams, Anthony Abbot, Rita Weiman, S.

Novel by John Riddell (Corey Ford), 1939Study of detective fiction\nIn addition to his success as a writer of fiction, Wright's lengthy introduction and notes to the anthology The World's Great Detective Stories (1927) are important in the history of the critical study of detective fiction. Although dated by the passage of time, this essay is still a core around which many other such commentaries have been constructed. He also wrote an article, \"Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories\", in 1928 for The American Magazine It has been frequently reprinted and compared to \"Knox's (Ten) Commandments\" by Ronald Knox.\nShort film series\nWright wrote a series of scenarios for Warner Brothers film studio in the early 1930s. These were used as the basis for a series of 12 two-reel \"murder mystery\" films, each approximately 20 minutes long, that were released in 1931 - 1932. Of these, The Skull Murder Mystery shows Wright's vigorous plot construction. It is also notable for its non-stereotypical treatment of Chinese characters, something quite unusual in its day.Donald Meek (as Dr. Crabtree) and John Hamilton (as Inspector Carr) were featured players, with Joseph Henabery directing. Three titles (The Wall Street Mystery, The Studio Murder Mystery, and the Trans-Atlantic Murder Mystery) have been released on DVD as extras on Forbidden Hollywood Collection Volume 3 (Warner). The titles are followed by dates reviewed by Film Daily:\nThe Clyde Mystery (September 27, 1931). This starred Donald Meek and Helen Flint.\nThe Wall Street Mystery (November 4, 1931)\nThe Week End Mystery (December 6, 1931). Advertised as The Week-End Mystery\nThe Symphony Murder Mystery (January 10, 1932). Advertised as The Symphony Mystery\nThe Studio Murder Mystery (February 7, 1932)\nThe Skull Murder Mystery (March 1932)\nThe Cole Case (The Cole Murder Case) (April 3, 1932)\nMurder in the Pullman (May 22, 1932)\nThe Side Show Mystery (June 11, 1932). Advertised as The Sideshow Mystery\nThe Campus Mystery (July 2, 1932). This is the only title in the series without Donald Meek.\nThe Crane Poison Case (July 9, 1932)\nThe Trans-Atlantic Murder Mystery (August 31, 1932). Advertised as The Transatlantic MysteryAs far as it is known, none of Van Dine's screen treatments has been published in book form, and none of the manuscripts survive. Short films were popular then, and Hollywood made hundreds of them during the studio era. Except for a handful of famous comedies, short films are not often discussed in more recent film reference books like features and animated cartoons often are.\nOn 13 September 1932, a $500,000 plagiarism suit was filed against Van Dine and the Vitaphone Film Company by Arlo Channing Edington and Carmen Ballen Edington who charged that their novel, The Studio Murder Mystery, which had been filmed by Paramount in 1929, had been \"'lifted' - title, plot and incident\"  and produced by the film company, credited to Van Dine. The outcome of the suit is unknown.\n\nLate career and death\nFrom a monetary perspective, Wright was fortunate in his experiences with Hollywood, and he was lionized on his visits to the movie capital. All but two of his novels were made into feature-length films, and the role of Philo Vance was played in different film versions by stars as popular as William Powell (before his Nick Charles period), Basil Rathbone, and Edmund Lowe. Louise Brooks (in The Canary Murder Case), Jean Arthur (in The Green Murder Case), and Rosalind Russell (in The Casino Murder Case) appeared in the S.S. Van Dine movies.On April 11, 1939, at age 50, Wright died in New York of a heart condition exacerbated by excessive drinking, a year after the publication of an unpopular experimental novel that incorporated one of the biggest stars in radio comedy, The Gracie Allen Murder Case. He left behind a complete novelette-length story that was intended as a film vehicle for Sonja Henie and was published posthumously as The Winter Murder Case. Max Perkins generously referred to Wright at the time of Wright's death as a \"gallant, gentle man\" who had been tormented by the pressures of a market-driven age.  His portrait, painted by his brother in 1914, hangs in the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.\nReferences\nBibliography\nDolmetsch, Carl, ed. (1966).

His published works include poetry, short stories, novels, literary criticism, a play, and an autobiography.\nBiography\nEarly years\nAiken was the eldest son of William Ford and Anna (Potter) Aiken. In Savannah, Aiken's father became a respected physician and eye surgeon, while his mother was the daughter of a prominent Massachusetts Unitarian minister. On February 27, 1901, Dr. Aiken murdered his wife and then committed suicide. According to his autobiography, Ushant, Aiken, then 11 years old, heard the two gunshots and discovered the bodies immediately thereafter. After his parents' deaths, he was raised by his great-aunt and uncle in Cambridge, Massachusetts, attending Middlesex School then Harvard University.At Harvard, Aiken edited the Advocate with T. S. Eliot, who became a lifelong friend, colleague, and influencer. It was also at Harvard where Aiken studied under another significant influencer in his writing, the philosopher George Santayana.\nAdult years\nAiken was strongly influenced by symbolism, especially in his earlier works. In 1930 he received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his Selected Poems. Many of his writings had strong psychological themes. He wrote the widely anthologized short story \"Silent Snow, Secret Snow\" (1934), partially based on his childhood tragedy.Other influences were Aiken's grandfather, Potter, who had been a church preacher, as well as Whitman's freestyle poetry.  This helped Aiken shape his poetry more freely while his recognition of a God grounded his more visually rich explorations into the universe. Some of his best-known poetry, such as \"Morning Song of Senlin\", use these influences to great effect.\nHis collections of verse include Earth Triumphant (1914), The Charnel Rose (1918) and And In the Hanging Gardens (1933). His poem \"Music I Heard\" has been set to music by a number of composers, including Leonard Bernstein and Henry Cowell. Aiken wrote or edited more than 51 books, the first of which was published in 1914, two years after his graduation from Harvard. His work includes novels, short stories (The Collected Short Stories appeared in 1961), reviews, an autobiography, and poetry. He received numerous awards and honors for his writing, though for most of his lifetime, he received little public attention.Though Aiken was reluctant to speak of his early trauma and ensuing psychological problems, he acknowledged that his writings were strongly influenced by his studies of Sigmund Freud, Carl G. Jung, Otto Rank, Ferenczi, Adler, and other depth psychologists. It wasn't until the publication of his autobiography, Ushant, that Aiken revealed the emotional challenges that he had battled for much of his adult life. During the 1920s Freud heard of him, and offered to psychoanalyze him. While aboard a Europe-bound ship to meet with Freud, Aiken was discouraged by Erich Fromm from accepting the offer. Consequently, despite Freud's strong influence on Aiken, Aiken never met the noted psychoanalyst. As he later shared, \"Freud had read Great Circle, and I\u2019m told kept a copy on his office table. But I didn't go, though I started to. Misgivings set in, and so did poverty.\"\nPersonal life\nAiken married Jessie McDonald in 1912, and the couple moved to England in 1921 with their youngest two children; John (born 1913) and Jane (born 1917), settling in Rye, East Sussex (where the American novelist Henry James had once lived). Aiken returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a tutor at Harvard from 1927 to 1928. For many years, he divided his time between Rye, New York, and Boston. In 1936, he met his third wife, Mary, in Boston. In the following year the couple visited Malcolm Lowry in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where Aiken divorced Clarissa and married Mary. The couple moved to Rye, where they remained until the outbreak of World War II in 1940. The Aikens settled in Brewster, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, where he and his wife Mary later ran a summer program for writers and painters named after their antique farmhouse, \"Forty-One Doors\". Despite living for many years abroad and receiving recognition as a Southern writer, Aiken always considered himself an American, and, in particular, a New Englander.Over the years, he served in loco parentis as well as mentor to the English author Malcolm Lowry. In 1923 he acted as a witness at the marriage of his friend, poet W. H. Davies. From 1950 to 1952, he served as Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, more commonly known as Poet Laureate of the United States. In 1960 he visited Grasmere in the Lake District, England (once the home of William Wordsworth), with his friend from Rye, painter Edward Burra.\nThe Aikens lived primarily at their farmhouse in West Brewster, and wintered in Savannah in a home adjacent to his early childhood house.Aiken died on 17 August 1973 and was buried in Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia on the banks of the Wilmington River, and so was Mary after her death in 1992. The burial site was featured in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil by John Berendt. According to local legend, Aiken wished to have his tombstone fashioned in the shape of a bench as an invitation to visitors to stop and enjoy a martini at his grave. The bench is inscribed with \"Give my love to the world\", and \"Cosmos Mariner\u2014Destination Unknown\".\nHe was married three times: firstly to Jessie McDonald (1912\u20131929); secondly to Clarissa Lorenz (1930\u20131937) (author of a biography, Lorelei Two); and thirdly to the painter Mary Hoover (1937\u20131973). He fathered three children by his first wife Jessie: John Aiken, Jane Aiken Hodge and Joan Aiken, all of whom became writers.\nAiken had three younger siblings, Kempton Potter (K. P. A. Taylor), Robert Potter (R. P. A. Taylor), and Elizabeth. After their parents' deaths, the four children were adopted by Frederick Winslow Taylor and his wife Louise, their great-aunt. His siblings took Taylor's last name. Kempton helped establish the Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry.\nA primary source for information on Aiken's life is his autobiographical novel Ushant (1952), one of his major works. In it, he wrote candidly about his various affairs and marriages, his attempted suicide and fear of insanity, and his friendships with T. S. Eliot (who appears in the book as the Tsetse), Ezra Pound (Rabbi Ben Ezra), Malcolm Lowry (Hambo), and others.\n\nAwards and recognition\nNamed Poetry Consultant (now U.S. Poet Laureate) of the Library of Congress from 1950 to 1952, Aiken earned numerous prestigious writing honors, including a Pulitzer Prize in 1930 for Selected Poems, the 1954 National Book Award for Collected Poems, the Bollingen Prize in Poetry, the National Institute of Arts and Letters Gold Medal in Poetry, and a National Medal for Literature. He was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship in 1934, Academy of American Poets fellowship in 1957, Huntington Hartford Foundation Award in 1960, and Brandeis University Creative Arts Award in 1967. Aiken was the first Georgia-born author to win a Pulitzer Prize, and was named Georgia's Poet Laureate in 1973. He was the first winner of the Poetry Society of America (PSA) Shelley Memorial Award, in 1929.\nIn 2009, the Library of America selected Aiken's 1931 story \"Mr. Arcularis\" for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American fantastic tales.\n\nSelected works\nPoetry collections\nEarth Triumphant (Aiken, 1914) (available online at archive.org)\nTurns and Movies and other Tales in Verse (Aiken, 1916, Houghton Mifflin) (available online at archive.org)\nThe Jig of Forslin: A Symphony, 1916\nNocturne of Remembered Spring: And Other Poems (Aiken, 1917) (available online at archive.org)\nCharnel Rose (Aiken, 1918) (available online at archive.org)\nThe House of Dust: A Symphony, 1920\nPunch: The Immortal Liar, Documents in His History, 1921\nPriapus and the Pool, 1922\nThe Pilgrimage of Festus, 1923\nPriapus and the Pool, and Other Poems, 1925\nSelected Poems, 1929\nJohn Deth, A Metaphysical Legacy, and Other Poems, 1930\nThe Coming Forth by Day of Osiris Jones, 1931\nPreludes for Memnon, 1931\nLandscape West of Eden, 1934\nTime in the Rock; Preludes to Definition, 1936\nAnd in the Human Heart, 1940\nBrownstone Eclogues, and Other Poems, 1942\nThe Soldier: A Poem, 1944\nThe Kid, 1947\nThe Divine Pilgrim, 1949\nSkylight One: Fifteen Poems, 1949\nCollected Poems, 1953\nA Letter from Li Po and Other Poems, 1955\nSheepfold Hill: Fifteen Poems, 1958\nThe Morning Song of Lord Zero, Poems Old and New, 1963\nThee: A Poem, 1967\nCollected Poems, 2nd ed., 1970Short Stories\n\"Bring!

Frank is best known for his studies of Spanish and Latin American literature and culture and his work is regarded as an intellectual bridge between the two continents.\nA radical political activist during the years of the Great Depression, Frank delivered a keynote speech to the first congress of the League of American Writers and was the first chair of that organization. Frank broke with the Communist Party, USA in 1937 over its treatment of exiled Soviet leader Leon Trotsky, whom Frank met in Mexico in January of that year.\n\nBiography\nEarly years\nWaldo Frank was born in Long Branch, New Jersey on August 25, 1889, during his family's summer vacation. He was the youngest of four children to Julius J. Frank, a prosperous Wall Street attorney employed by the Hamburg-Amerika Line, and his wife, the former Helene Rosenberg, who hailed from the American South and was the daughter of a Confederate blockade runner during the American Civil War.The young Frank grew up on the Upper West Side of New York City, where he attended DeWitt Clinton High School. He was expelled from school for refusing to take a Shakespeare course, saying that he knew more than the teacher and subsequently spent a year attending a college preparatory boarding school in Lausanne, Switzerland. Upon his return to the United States, Frank enrolled at Yale University, first earning a bachelor's degree before completing his Masters degree in 1911.Following graduation, Frank worked briefly as a reporter for the New York Times before leaving in 1913 for Paris, where he went to read and write. With World War I in the wings, Frank returned to New York City in 1914.\nLiterary career\nFrank's first published novel, The Unwelcome Man (1917), was a psychoanalytic look into a man contemplating suicide.  The novel also drew upon the ideas of New England transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson and the poet Walt Whitman.In 1916, Frank became associate editor of The Seven Arts, a journal that ran for just twelve issues but became an important artistic and political influence. Its contributors were determined pacifists, a position that caused a decline in subscriptions and supporting funds. Contributors included Randolph Bourne, Van Wyck Brooks, and James Oppenheim, the founder and general editor of the magazine.In January 1917, Frank married Margaret Naumburg, a postgraduate pupil of John Dewey. She developed techniques which later became known as art therapy.In 1921 Frank met and became intense friends with the young writer, Jean Toomer. He served as editor for Toomer's first novel, Cane (1923), a modernist work combining poems and associated stories, inspired by his working in the rural South as a school principal at a black school. Toomer became an important figure in the Harlem Renaissance; of mixed-race and majority-white, complex ethnicity, he resisted being classified as a black writer and said he was \"an American\". They had a falling out and their friendship ended after 1923, due in part to an affair between Toomer and Naumburg.Frank became a regular contributor to the New Yorker in 1925 under the pseudonym \"Search-Light\".\n\nPolitical activity\nFrank was an anti-militarist and declared himself a conscientious objector in registering for the draft in 1917. He became increasingly political during the 1920s, joining the liberal magazine The New Republic as a contributing editor in November 1925.In 1929 together with fellow writers Sherwood Anderson, Theodore Dreiser, and others Frank worked to raise money for striking workers in Southern textile mills. He toured the Soviet Union in the summer and early fall of 1931 and returned to write a book on his experiences, Dawn of Russia, published in 1932. Frank also went to Harlan County, Kentucky in 1932 in support of striking coal miners on behalf of the Independent Miners Relief Committee, where he was attacked by vigilantes and forcibly removed from the strike area.By the middle 1930s, Frank had moved close to the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), culminating in his being tapped as speaker at the opening session of the founding convention of Communist-organized League of American Writers in April 1935. Frank was subsequently elected as the chairman of that organization.During the United States Presidential election of 1936, Frank was active in the ranks of Professional Groups for Browder and Ford, working in support of the CPUSA ticket. Frank's efforts on behalf of the Communist Party brought him some minor legal trouble when he was arrested together with CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder when the two were campaigning in Terre Haute, Indiana on September 30, 1936.In January 1937, Frank went to Mexico to attend the congress of the League of Revolutionary Artists and Writers. There he interviewed Leon Trotsky, held by the Joseph Stalin-led world Communist movement to be the leader of an international conspiracy to sabotage and overthrow the government of the USSR and the Russian Revolution itself. Upon his return to the United States, Frank suggested in a letter to The New Republic that an international tribunal be established to investigate the merit or lack thereof regarding the charges made by the Soviet against Trotsky. This brought a harsh reply from Earl Browder, leading to a break between Frank and the Communist Party and his denunciation by Browder at the Second Converess of the League of American Writers in June 1937.Frank largely removed himself from political activity during the 1950s until in the fall of 1959 he visited revolutionary Cuba and was impressed enough to temporarily accept the position of chairman of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He published his final book, Cuba: Prophetic Island, a sympathetic account of the Cuban revolution, in 1961.\nHispanic cultural studies\nWaldo Frank was regarded as a living cultural bridge between North America and Latin America.\nAlready believing in Hispanic spiritual values, Frank traveled to Spain in 1921. He published his cultural study, Virgin Spain (1926). He had envisioned that there needed to be an organic synthesis of the two Americas: North and South, Anglo and Hispanic. He thought that Spain had achieved a \"spiritual synthesis of its warring religions\" and could be \"an example of wholeness\" for the New World. Having also spent time in Spain, writer Ernest Hemingway mocked Frank's ideas in his novel, Death in the Afternoon (1932).Frank's novel, Rediscovery of America (1929), also expressed some of his utopian ideas. After this and other novels were less commercially successful than he thought they deserved, Frank turned his attention to politics. His thesis about the spiritual strengths of Latin America won him wide acclaim when he toured there in 1929. His lecture tour was organized by the University of Mexico, as well as Argentinian editor Samuel Glusberg and Peruvian cultural theorist Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui. The latter had serialized parts of Rediscovery of America (without Frank's authorization) in the journal Amauta.\nIt was in South America that Frank's literary influence was greatest. Due to his successful reception there, the United States State Department asked him to tour in 1942, to try to discourage alliances with the Nazi government in Germany during World War II. In 1942 while in Argentina, Frank denounced the pro-Nazi drift of the Argentine government, and it declared him a persona non grata. During his stay in Buenos Aires, Frank was attacked in his apartment by six armed men in response to \"some opinions he expressed in regards to Argentine neutrality\" in the war. He was pistol whipped and repeatedly kicked in the head. He suffered a \"concussion of marked severity.\" The attack was believed to be the work of pro-Nazi sympathizers who posed as detectives checking to see if Frank's \"papers were in order.\" Based on his travels in the region and continuing studies, Frank published South American Journey in 1943 and Birth of a World: Simon Bolivar in Terms of His Peoples in 1951.\nDeath and legacy\nWaldo Frank died  January 9, 1967 in White Plains, New York.\n\nBibliography\nBooks\nFrank, Waldo (1917).

He is best known for his work Anthony Adverse, regarded by many critics \"as the model and precursor of the contemporary American historical novel.\"\nEarly life\nAllen was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 8, 1889 to William Hervey Allen and Helen Ebey Myers. He graduated from Shady Side Academy in 1909. He was a midshipman with the United States Navy from 1909 to 1910, and attended the United States Naval Academy from 1910 to 1911 when he was honorably discharged due to a track and field injury.Allen received a BS in Economics from the University of Pittsburgh in 1915 where he contributed to the humor magazine The Pitt Panther.  While at college, he also became a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity.Allen served as a 2nd lieutenant in the 18th Pennsylvania Infantry on the Mexican border in 1916 during the Pancho Villa Expedition. That year he published a collection of poems, Ballads of the Border. He also served as a lieutenant in the 28th (keystone) Division, United States Army during World War I and fought in the Aisne-Marne offensive July\u2013August 1918.  He was wounded in action at Fismes in August 1918. He also taught English to French soldiers at Favernay.\n\nAcademic career\nAllen became a Professor of English at the University of Pittsburgh. For a period of time, he taught at the Porter Military Academy in Charleston, South Carolina. He also taught English at Charleston High School which at that time, although public, was only for boys. (The girls went to Memminger.) There he met and befriended DuBose Heyward. They collaborated on a volume of poems, Carolina Chansons (1922).In 1925, he lectured on American Literature at Columbia University. From 1926 to 1927, he was a lecturer on modern poetry at Vassar College, where he met his future wife.\nWriting career\nHe wrote Toward the Flame (1926), a nonfictional account of his experiences in the war. His book, Wampum and Old Gold, was awarded the Yale Younger Poets Prize. Allen is best known for his work Anthony Adverse. The book sold well and the royalties supported Allen and his family for the rest of his life.Allen greatly admired Thomas Jefferson. \"Interest in American history and in a sort of American utopianism would characterize most of his later works.\" He planned a series of novels about colonial America called The Disinherited. He completed three works in the series: The Forest and the Fort (1943), Bedford Village (1944), and Toward the Morning (1948). The novels tell the story of Salathiel Albine, a frontiersman kidnapped as a boy by Shawnee Indians in the 1750s. All three works were collected and published as the City in the Dawn. Allen also wrote Israfel (1926), a biography of American writer Edgar Allan Poe.\nIn the 1940s, he co-edited the Rivers of America Series with Carl Carmer. Allen was a good friend of Marjory Stoneman Douglas and instigated her writing The Everglades: River of Grass. Allen was close friends with Robert Frost and Ogden Nash.\n\nPersonal life\nHe married Ann Andrews on June 30, 1927. The marriage to his much younger former student was viewed as somewhat scandalous, and the couple took up residence in Bermuda. They had three children: Marcia, Mary Ann and Richard.\nDeath and legacy\nAllen died at his home, called the Glades, in Coconut Grove, Florida, aged 60, from a heart attack, and was found by his wife.

The National Portrait Gallery, London holds four portraits of her.\nCareer\nGB Stern was born on 17 June 1890 in North Kensington, London, the second, by some years, of two sisters. Her family lost their money in the Vaal River diamond crash. After that, they lived in a series of apartments, hotels and boarding houses. Gladys was schooled in England until the age of 16, when, with her parents, she traveled to the continent and studied in Germany and Switzerland.She wrote her first novel, Pantomime, in 1914 at the age of 24. Her first critical success came with Twos and Threes in 1916. Her most popular books were the series known by the name of the first, The Matriarch. This was first published as Tents of Israel in 1924. The others in the series are A Deputy Was King (1926), Mosaic (1930), Shining and Free (1935) and The Young Matriarch (1942).The Matriarch series revolved around the Rakonitz and Czelovar families and were based on her own family. They are well-to-do and cosmopolitan Jews who settled in England from Hungary, Poland, Russia, and Austria. Like her family, they suffer through an economic crash.The first book in the series, The Matriarch, centers around two characters, the matriarch Anastasia and her granddaughter, Toni. Anastasia was based on Stern's great-aunt, who was incensed with the portrayal until the book became successful. The book describes in detail the complicated, florid and noisy life of this Jewish-English family through both triumphs and failures, weddings and funerals.Stern's plays include The Man Who Pays The Piper (1931), which was revived by the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond, London in 2013.\nWith Sheila Kaye-Smith she wrote the dialogues Talking of Jane Austen and More Talk of Jane Austen. She also wrote a biography of Robert Louis Stevenson.\nHer final novel, Promise Not to Tell, was published in 1964.In 1947, The Woman in the Hall was released as a film.\nIn 1966 her 1938 novel The Ugly Dachshund was made into a film.\n\nPersonal life\nShe married New Zealander Geoffrey Lisle Holdsworth in 1919 and divorced him \"fairly soon after\". Her closest male friends were the playwright John van Druten and Jack Cohen. A long-time friend was Rebecca West, who came to call her \"Peter\", as did most of Stern's friends. Stern went through a number of secretaries but Freda Bromhead managed to survive five years with her and came back to help her years later when Stern was in a nursing home.Her family was never terribly religious and Stern herself disliked the word 'Jew' and preferred 'Israelite'.  In 1947 she converted to Catholicism. She wrote about the conversion in 1954 in All in Good Time.She died in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, England on 28 September 1973, at the age of 83.\nWorks\nReferences\nSources\nG. B.

His real name was S\u014dichi Uemura (\u690d\u6751 \u5b97\u4e00, Uemura S\u014dichi).\n\nEarly life\nNaoki Sanj\u016bgo was born in what is now Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Osaka. The noted historian Uemura Seiji, specialist in East Asian history, was his brother. Against the wishes of his father, Naoki attended the preparatory schools of Waseda University to study English Literature but was forced to drop out of school on occasion due to his inability to pay the tuition. In 1920, he collaborated with Ton Satomi, Masao Kume, and Isamu Yoshii on the literary journal Ningen (\"Human\"). He returned to Osaka shortly after Great Kant\u014d earthquake of 1923. At first, he attempted to work at a cosmetics company, but was soon drawn back to the literary world.\n\nLiterary career\nAt the invitation of Matsutar\u014d Kawaguchi, Naoki started working in Osaka as editor of the literary magazine Kuraku (\"Joys and Sorrows\"), contributed his own works of fiction as well, and soon began publishing novels. Although interested in the new trends toward the cinema, he experimented with movie script-writing but failed to interest any movie studios. In 1927, he moved back to Tokyo where opportunities looked more promising. He obtained a post at the literary magazine Bungeishunj\u016b, where he developed a reputation for writing scathing literary criticism, mixed with scandalous gossip about the writer, which outraged many of his contemporaries.\nIn 1929, he had an historical novel, Yui Kongen Taisakki, serialized in a weekly magazine, and a similar historical novel about the Satsuma Rebellion, Nangoku Taiheiki, serialized in a newspaper following year. The success of these established him firmly as a writer of popular fiction. \nHis novel Mito Komon Kaikokuki, a fictional history of the travels of Tokugawa Mitsukuni in disguise around the country was the basis of a movie starring Ry\u016bnosuke Tsukigata and was the first of nearly fifty of his novels to be made into movies. It later metamorphosed into the extremely long-running television series Mito K\u014dmon, which remains popular to this day and which is largely responsible for turning the historical Tokugawa Mitsukuni into a folk hero.\nNaoki had a reputation for being eccentric, as evidenced by his choice of a pen-name, which he changed four times between ages 31 and 35 to match his age (skipping over 34, as four is an unlucky number according to Japanese superstition). When he reached age 35 (Sanj\u016bgo), he decided to keep the same name from that point onward.\nAs well as historical novels such as Araki Mataemon and Odoriko Gyojoki, Naoki wrote biographies of historical figures \u2014 including Kusunoki Masashige, Ashikaga Takauji, and Genkuro Yoshitsune \u2014 and contemporary social fiction, including Nihon no Senritsu (\"Japan Shudders\") and Hikari: Tsumi to Tomoni (\"Light: With Crime\").\n\nDeath\nNaoki died in 1934 at the age of 43 from an acute case of Japanese encephalitis. Yasunari Kawabata, with whom Naoki shared a common interest in the game of go, wrote the eulogy for his funeral. His grave is at the temple of Ch\u014dsh\u014d-ji in Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama.\n\nLegacy\nIn 1935, on the suggestion of Kikuchi Kan (founder of the  Bungeishunj\u016b magazine), Naoki's name was given to an award for popular fiction, the Naoki Prize. Alongside the Akutagawa Prize for new writers, it is one of the most prestigious literary awards in Japan.\n\nSee also\nJapanese literature\nList of Japanese authors\nNaoki PrizeReferences\nFukuyama, Hikomaro.

He had problems completing Azabu Middle School due to poor health and his complete incompetence in mathematics. At the time he was also working part-time delivering newspapers, and his inability to add often meant that his parents had to make up for the short-fall in his accounts.\n\nLiterary career\nHowever, Hirotsu did show a talent for literature from an early age. His literary debut came with a short story submitted to a contest in a newspaper when he was 17 years old. The story won a prize of 10 Yen, which was a reasonable sum of money in 1908. While attending Waseda University Hirotsu started submitting articles to various literary journals. One of his classmates at Waseda was Hinatsu K\u014dnosuke. In 1912, Hirotsu joined Zenz\u014d Kasai in establishing a literary magazine, Kiseki (\u201cMiracle\u201d), to which he contributed short stories and translated works of foreign authors. The magazine ceased publication the following year after seven editions.\nIn 1913, Hirotsu published a translation of Guy de Maupassant's Une Vie, which marked the beginning of a career of literary criticism and translation of various European writers. The same year, he graduated from Waseda University, and his family was evicted from their rented house due to inability to pay the rent. The following year, he was hospitalized for tuberculosis. His stepmother was also diagnosed with the disease, and his father and stepmother relocated to Nagoya, living Hirotsu at a boarding house in Tokyo, where he shared a room with Zenz\u014d Kasai for a time, while attempting to find work as a translator and submitting stories to newspapers and magazines. Hirotsu relocated from Tokyo to coastal Kamakura, Kanagawa from 1916.\nHis literary career began with a short story published in 1917: Shinkeibyo Jidai (\u201cThe Neurotic Age\u201d), in which he attacked the nihilism and moral decadence of contemporary intellectuals. A supporter of leftist politics, he was initially attracted to the Proletarian Literature Movement in the 1930s. During the 1930s he published Futari no Fukomono (\u201cTwo Unfortunate People\u201d) and Shiji o Daite (\u201cEmbracing a Dead Child\u201d), both objective stories, and Yamori (\u201cGecko\u201d) and Nami no Ue (\u201cOn the Waves\u201d), which belonged to the I novel genre.\nIn 1941, Hirotsu moved to Setagaya in Tokyo. His politics supported the Japanese government in World War II, and he was sent on a government-sponsored visit to Korea, where he met author Kim Saryan, and to Manchukuo, where he toured several Japanese settlements. In 1942, he joined the government-sponsored Japanese Cultural Protection Association, but came into conflict with Kunio Kishida, who was attempting to incorporate the Association into the Taisei Yokusankai political party. He also travelled to Nara to view various temples and antiquities in 1942. In 1944, due to the danger of air raids in Tokyo during World War II, he relocated to the resort town of Atami.\nIn 1946, Hirotsu was diagnosed with bladder cancer at the Atami National Hospital. While recuperating in Atami, he occasionally met with fellow Atami resident Shiga Naoya in 1948. Hirotsu became a member of the Japan Art Academy in 1949 together with K\u014dji Uno. In 1950, his house in Atami burned down, and he was forced to relocate to a different location, but still within Atami. On occasion, he also maintained apartments in Tokyo.\nIn the post-war period, Hirotsu wrote a number of biographical and autobiographical works, Ano Jidai (\u201cThose Times\u201d), and Nengetsu no Ashiato (\u201cThe Footsteps of Time\u201d, 1961\u20131963), which won the 1963 Noma Literary Prize; however, he devoted 10 years from 1953-1963 writing an obsessively detailed defense of the alleged saboteurs in the controversial Matsukawa incident. This work was published under Izumi e no michi (\u201cThe Road to Spring\u201d, 1953\u20131954) and Matsukawa Saiban (\u201cThe Matsukawa Trial\u201d, 1954\u20131958). Hirotsu led a citizen's support group for the defendants, who, after twelve years in the courts, were eventually found innocent.\nHirotsu died of a heart attack at the Atami National Hospital in Atami in 1968 at the age of 76. His grave is at the Yanaka Cemetery, Tokyo.\nHis daughter Momoko Hirotsu (1918-1988) was also a novelist.\n\nSee also\nJapanese literature\nList of Japanese authorsReferences\nKeene, Donald.

He is regarded as the \"father of the Japanese short story\", and Japan's premier literary award, the Akutagawa Prize, is named after him. He committed suicide at the age of 35 through an overdose of barbital.\nEarly life\nRy\u016bnosuke Akutagawa was born in the Ky\u014dbashi district of Tokyo, the third child and only son of father Toshiz\u014d N\u012bhara and mother Fuku Akutagawa. He was named \"Ry\u016bnosuke\" (\"Son [of] Dragon\") because he was born in the Year of the Dragon, in the Month of the Dragon, on the Day of the Dragon, and at the Hour of the Dragon. His mother experienced a mental illness shortly after his birth, so he was adopted and raised by his maternal uncle, D\u014dsh\u014d Akutagawa, from whom he received the Akutagawa family name. He was interested in classical Chinese literature from an early age, as well as in the works of Mori \u014cgai and Natsume S\u014dseki.\nHe entered the First High School in 1910, developing relationships with classmates such as Kan Kikuchi, Kume Masao, Y\u016bz\u014d Yamamoto, and Tsuchiya Bunmei, all of whom would later become authors. He began writing after entering Tokyo Imperial University in 1913, where he studied English literature.\nWhile still a student he proposed marriage to a childhood friend, Yayoi Yoshida, but his adoptive family did not approve the union. In 1916 he became engaged to Fumi Tsukamoto, whom he married in 1918. They had three children: Hiroshi Akutagawa (1920\u20131981) was an actor, Takashi Akutagawa (1922\u20131945) was killed as a student draftee in Burma, and Yasushi Akutagawa (1925\u20131989) was a composer.\nAfter graduation, he taught briefly at the Naval Engineering School in Yokosuka, Kanagawa as an English language instructor, before deciding to devote his full efforts to writing.\n\nLiterary career\nIn 1914, Akutagawa and his former high school friends revived the literary journal Shinshich\u014d (\"New Currents of Thought\"), publishing translations of William Butler Yeats and Anatole France along with their own works. Akutagawa published his second short story Rash\u014dmon the following year in the literary magazine Teikoku Bungaku (\"Imperial Literature\"), while still a student. The story, based on a twelfth-century tale, was not well received by Akutagawa's friends, who criticized it extensively. Nonetheless, Akutagawa gathered the courage to visit his idol, Natsume S\u014dseki, in December 1915 for S\u014dseki's weekly literary circles. In November, he published his short story Rashomon on Teikoku Mongaku, a literary magazine. In early 1916 he published Hana (\"The Nose\", 1916), which attracted a letter of praise from S\u014dseki and secured Akutagawa his first taste of fame.It was also at this time that he started writing haiku under the haigo (or pen-name) Gaki. Akutagawa followed with a series of short stories set in Heian period, Edo period or early Meiji period Japan. These stories reinterpreted classical works and historical incidents. Examples of these stories include: Gesaku zanmai (\"A Life Devoted to Gesaku\", 1917) and Kareno-sh\u014d (\"Gleanings from a Withered Field\", 1918), Jigoku hen (\"Hell Screen\", 1918); H\u014dky\u014dnin no shi (\"The Death of a Christian\", 1918), and But\u014dkai (\"The Ball\", 1920). Akutagawa was a strong opponent of naturalism. He published Mikan (\"Mandarin Oranges\", 1919) and Aki (\"Autumn\", 1920) which have more modern settings.\nIn 1921, Akutagawa interrupted his writing career to spend four months in China, as a reporter for the Osaka Mainichi Shinbun. The trip was stressful and he suffered from various illnesses, from which his health would never recover. Shortly after his return he published Yabu no naka (\"In a Grove\", 1922). During the trip, Akutagawa visited numerous cities of southeastern China including Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Suzhou. Before his travel, he wrote a short story \"The Christ of Nanjing\"; concerning the Chinese Christian community; according to his own imagination of Nanjing influenced by Classical Chinese literature.\nInfluences\nAkutagawa's stories were influenced by his belief that the practice of literature should be universal and can bring together western and Japanese cultures. This can be seen in the way that Akutagawa uses existing works from a variety of cultures and time periods and either rewrites the story with modern sensibilities or creates new stories using ideas from multiple sources. \nCulture and the formation of a cultural identity is also a major theme in several of Akutagawa's works. In these stories, he explores the formation of cultural identity during periods in history where Japan was most open to outside influences. An example of this is his story H\u014dky\u014dnin no Shi (\"The Martyr\", 1918) which is set in the early missionary period.\nThe portrayal of women in Akutagawa's stories was shaped by the influence of three women who acted as a mother for Akutagawa. Most significantly his biological mother Fuku, from whom he worried about inheriting her mental illness. Though he did not spend much time with Fuku he identified strongly with her, believing that if at any moment he might go mad life was meaningless. His aunt Fuki played the most significant role in his upbringing. Fuki controlled much of Akutagawa's life, demanding much of his attention especially as she grew older. Women that appear in Akutagawa's stories, much like the women he identified as mothers, were mostly written as dominating, aggressive, deceitful, and selfish. Conversely, men were often represented as the victims of such women, such as in Kesa to Morito (\"Kesa and Morito\", 1918), in which the leading female character attempts to control the actions of both her lover and husband.\n\nLater life\nThe final phase of Akutagawa's literary career was marked by his deteriorating physical and mental health. Much of his work during this period is distinctly autobiographical, some even taken directly from his diaries. His works during this period include Daid\u014dji Shinsuke no hansei (\"The Early Life of Daid\u014dji Shinsuke\", 1925) and Tenkibo (\"Death Register\", 1926).\nAkutagawa had a highly publicized dispute with Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki over the importance of structure versus lyricism in story. Akutagawa argued that structure, how the story was told, was more important than the content or plot of the story, whereas Tanizaki argued the opposite.\nAkutagawa's final works include Kappa (1927), a satire based on a creature from Japanese folklore, Haguruma (\"Spinning Gears\", 1927), Aru ah\u014d no issh\u014d (\"A Fool's Life\"), and Bungeiteki na, amari ni bungeiteki na (\"Literary, All Too Literary\", 1927).\nTowards the end of his life, Akutagawa began suffering from visual hallucinations and anxiety over the fear that he had inherited his mother's mental disorder. In 1927 he attempted suicide, together with a friend of his wife, but the attempt failed. He later successfully committed suicide after taking an overdose of Veronal, which had been given to him by Saito Mokichi on 24 July of the same year. His dying words in his will claimed he felt a \"vague insecurity\" (\u307c\u3093\u3084\u308a\u3057\u305f\u4e0d\u5b89, bon'yari shita fuan) about the future. He was 35 years old.\n\nLegacy\nAkutagawa wrote over 150 short stories during his brief life. Akira Kurosawa's classic 1950 film Rash\u014dmon retells Akutagawa's \"In a Grove\". The title and the frame scenes set in the Rashomon Gate are taken from Akutagawa's \"Rash\u014dmon\". Ukrainian composer Victoria Poleva wrote the ballet Gagaku (1994), based on Akutagawa's \"Hell Screen\". Japanese composer Mayako Kubo wrote an opera named Rashomon, based on Akutagawa's story. The German version premiered in Graz, Austria in 1996, and the Japanese version in Tokyo in 2002.\nIn 1935, Akutagawa's lifelong friend Kan Kikuchi established the literary award for promising new writers, the Akutagawa Prize, in his honor.\n\nSelected works\nSelected works in translation\nTales of Grotesque and Curious.

He was married to the poet Hilda Doolittle (H.D.) from 1911 to 1938.\nAldington's 50-year career included work in poetry, novels, criticism and biography. He edited The Egoist literary journal and wrote for magazines such as The Times Literary Supplement, Vogue, The Criterion and Poetry. His biography of Wellington (1946) was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. His circle included writers and critics such as T. S. Eliot, D. H. Lawrence, Ezra Pound, W. B. Yeats, Lawrence Durrell and C. P. Snow. He championed H.D. as the major poetic voice of the Imagist movement and helped to bring her work to international notice.\nEarly life and marriage\nAldington was born in Portsmouth, the eldest of four children, and was the son of a solicitor. Both of his parents wrote and published books, and the home held a large library of European and classical literature. As well as reading, Aldington's interests at this time, all of which he continued in later life, included butterfly-collecting, hiking, and learning languages \u2013 he went on to master French, Italian, Latin and ancient Greek. He was educated at Mr Sweetman's Seminary for Young Gentlemen, St Margaret's Bay, near Dover. His father died of heart problems at age 56.Aldington studied at Dover College, the University of London. He was unable to complete his degree because of the financial circumstances of his family caused by his father's failed speculations and ensuing debt. Supported by a small allowance from his parents, he worked as a sports journalist, started publishing poetry in British journals and gravitated towards literary circles that included poets William Butler Yeats and Walter de la Mare.In 1911 Aldington met society hostess Brigit Patmore, with whom he had a passing affair. At the time he is described as a \"tall and broad-shouldered, with a fine forehead, thick longish hair of the indefinite colour blond hair turns to in adolescence, very bright blue eyes, too small a nose and a determined mouth.\" Through her he met American poets Ezra Pound and the poet Hilda Doolittle (H.D.), who had been previously engaged.  H.D. and Aldington grew closer and travelled together extensively through Italy and France, just before the war, in 1913. On their return to London in the summer they moved into separate flats in Churchwalk, Kensington, in West London. H.D. lived at number 6, Aldington at number 8 and Pound at number 10. In the presence of Pound and the Doolittle family, over from America for the summer, the couple married (marriage 1913\u20131938). They moved to 5 Holland Place Chambers into a flat of their own, although Pound soon moved in across the hall.The poets were caught up in the literary ferment before the war, where new politics and ideas were passionately discussed and created in Soho tearooms and society salons. The couple bonded over their visions of new forms of poetry, feminism and philosophy, emerging from the wake of staid Victorian mores. The couple were fed by a sense of peership and mutualism between them, rejecting hierarchies, beginning to view Pound as an intruder and interloper rather than a literary igniter.The couple met influential American poet Amy Lowell and she introduced them to writer D.H. Lawrence in 1914, who would go on to be a close friend and mentor to both.\nEarly career\nAldington's poetry was associated with the Imagist group, championing minimalist free verse with stark images, seeking to banish Victorian moralism. The group was key in the emerging Modernist movement. Ezra Pound coined the term imagistes for H.D. and Aldington (1912). Aldington's poetry forms almost one third of the Imagists' inaugural anthology Des Imagistes (1914). The movement was heavily inspired by Japanese and classical European art. Aldington shared T. E. Hulme's conviction that experimentation with traditional Japanese verse forms could provide a way forward for avant-garde literature in English.\nPound sent three of Aldington's poems to Harriet Monroe's magazine Poetry and they appeared in November 1912. She notes \"Mr Richard Aldington is a young English poet, one of the \"Imagistes\", a group of ardent Hellenists who are pursuing interesting experiments in vers libre.\"She considered the poem \"Choricos\" to be his finest work, \"one of the most beautiful death songs in the language\" \"a poem of studied and affected gravity\".H.D. became pregnant in August 1914 and in 1915 Aldington and H.D. relocated from their home in Holland Park near Ezra Pound to Hampstead close to D. H. Lawrence and Frieda. They felt calmer out of the bustle of the city, with more space and green. The pregnancy ended in a stillborn daughter which traumatised the couple and put a great strain on the relationship; H.D. was 28 and Aldington 22. The outbreak of war in 1914 deeply disturbed Aldington, though no draft was in place at this time. H.D. felt more distant from the melee, not having a close affinity to the European landscape, geographical or political. This rift also put pressure on the marriage. Unhappy, Aldington dreamed of escape to America and began to have affairs.He began a relationship with Florence Fallas, who had also lost a child. Between 1914 and 1916 Aldington was literary editor and a columnist at The Egoist. He was assistant editor with Leonard Compton-Rickett under Dora Marsden. Aldington knew Wyndham Lewis well and reviewed his work in The Egoist. He was also an associate of Ford Madox Ford, helping him with a propaganda volume for a government commission in 1914 and taking dictation for The Good Soldier.\n\nFirst World War and aftermath\nAldington joined up in June 1916 and was sent for training at Wareham in Dorset. H.D. moved to be closer to her husband. He then was sent to a camp near Manchester. They found the duality of their lives harsh, and the gruelling, regimented nature of the training felt hard for the sensitive professional poet. He felt fundamentally different from the other men, more given to intellectual pursuits than unending physical labour that left him little time to write. Their sporadic meetings were emotionally wrenching and the couple could make no plans for their future together. He encouraged H.D. to return to America where she could make a safer and more stable home. They both watched news come in of heavy troop losses in France at the Somme and on other battlefields. She could not have information given on her husband's future postings overseas, all held to be secret. Rationing and the forced draft began as the war turned against the British.When Aldington was sent to the front in December 1916, the couple's relationship became epistolary. He wrote that he'd managed to complete 12 poems and three essays since joining up and wanted to work on producing a new book, in order to keep his mind on literature, despite his work of digging graves. He found the soldier's life degrading, living with lice, cold, mud and little sanitation. His encounters with gas on the front would affect him for the rest of his life. He was given leave in July 1917 and the couple enjoyed a reunion during this brief reprieve. He felt distant from old Imagist friends like Pound who had not undergone the tortuous life of the soldiers on the front and could not imagine the living conditions.Aldington joined up in the 11th Leicestershires and was later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Sussex Regiment (November 1917). He finished the war as a signals officer and temporary captain, being demobilised in February 1919.He may never have completely recovered from the war, writing of his own field experiences in the collections Images of War and Images of Desire (1919), which were suffused with a new melancholy. He ended the war feeling disconsolate about his own talent as a poet. Exile and Other Poems (1923) also dealt with the process of trauma. A collection of war stories Roads to Glory, appeared in 1930. After this point he became known as a critic and biographer.Towards the end of the war H.D. lived with composer Cecil Gray, a friend of D. H. Lawrence. They had a daughter together in March 1919, the pregnancy much complicated by H.D. catching pneumonia towards the end. Neither Gray nor Aldington wanted to accept paternity. By the time of Aldington's return H.D. was involved with the female writer Bryher. H.D. and Aldington formally separated and had relationships with other people, but they didn't divorce until 1938. They remained friends for the rest of their lives. He destroyed all the couple's correspondence pre-1918.Aldington helped T. S. Eliot by persuading Harriet Shaw Weaver to appoint Eliot as Aldington's successor at The Egoist magazine. In 1919 he introduced Eliot to the editor Bruce Richmond of The Times Literary Supplement. Aldington was on the editorial board of Chaman Lall's London literary quarterly Coterie (published 1919\u20131921), accompanied by Conrad Aiken, Eliot, Lewis and Aldous Huxley. Eliot had a job in the international department of Lloyd's and well-meaning friends wanted him full-time writing poetry. Ezra Pound plotting a scheme to \"get Eliot out of the bank\" was supported by Lady Ottoline Morrell, Leonard Woolf and Harry Norton Aldington began publishing in journals such as the Imagist The Chapbook. In reply to Eliot's The Waste Land, Aldington wrote A Fool i' the Forest (1924). \n\nAldington suffered a breakdown in 1925. His interest in poetry waned, and he developed an animosity towards Eliot's celebrity. Aldington grew closer to Eliot but gradually became a supporter of Vivienne Eliot in the troubled marriage. Aldington satirised her husband as \"Jeremy Cibber\" in Stepping Heavenward (1931). He had a relationship with writer Valentine Dobr\u00e9e and had a lengthy and passionate affair with Arabella Yorke, a lover since Mecklenburgh Square days, coming to an end when he went abroad.\nExile\nAldington went into self-imposed exile in 1928. He lived in Paris for years, living with Brigit Patmore, and being fascinated by Nancy Cunard, whom he met in 1928. Following his divorce in 1938 he married Netta, n\u00e9e McCullough, previously Brigit's daughter-in-law.\nDeath of a Hero (1929), which Aldington called a \"jazz novel,\" was his semi-autobiographical response to the war. He started writing it almost immediately after the armistice was declared. The novel condemned Victorian materialism as a cause of the tragedy and waste of the war. Rejectionist, an \"Expressionist scream\", it was commended by Lawrence Durrell as \"the best war novel of the epoch\". It was developed mostly while Aldington was living on the island of Port-Cros in Provence, building on the manuscript from a decade before. Opening with a letter to the playwright Halcott Glover, the book takes a satirical, cynical and critical stance on Victorian and Edwardian cant. Published in September 1929, by Christmas it had sold more than 10,000 copies in England alone, part of a wave of war remembrances from writers such as Remarque, Sassoon and Hemingway. The book was quickly translated into German and other European languages. In Russia the book was taken to be a wholesale attack on bourgeois politics, \"the inevitable result of the life which had preceded it\", as Aldington wrote. \"The next one will be much worse\". It was praised by Gorky as revolutionary, and the book, along with his later fiction, received huge Russian distribution. Aldington was, however, fiercely non-partisan in his politics, despite his passion for iconoclasm and feminism.The character of George Winterbourne is loosely based on Aldington as an artist (Winterbourne a painter rather than writer), having a mistress before and through the war, and portrays locations strongly resembling those he had travelled to. One of these locations fictionally named \"The Chateau de Fressin\" strongly resembled a castle he wrote about in one of his letters to H.D.Death of a Hero, like many other novels published around this time about the war, suffered greatly from censorship. Instead of changing or cutting parts of his novel out, he replaced objectionable words with asterisks. Although they looked awkward on the page, Aldington, among others, wanted to call attention to censoring by publishers.In 1930 Aldington published a translation of The Decameron and then the romance All Men are Enemies (1933). In 1942, having relocated to the United States with his new wife Netta, he began to write biographies, starting with Wellington: The Duke: Being an Account of the Life & Achievements of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, (1943). It was followed by works on D. H. Lawrence: Portrait of a Genius, But... 1950), Robert Louis Stevenson: Portrait of a Rebel (1957), and T. E. Lawrence:Lawrence of Arabia: A Biographical Inquiry (1955). Under financial pressure, he also worked as a Hollywood screenwriter.\nAldington's later biography of T. E. Lawrence in 1955 caused a scandal on its publication, and an immediate backlash. In the spirit of iconoclasm, he was the first to bring public notice to Lawrence's illegitimacy and asserted that Lawrence was homosexual. He attacked the popular hero as a liar, a charlatan and an \"impudent mythomaniac\", claims that have coloured Lawrence's reputation ever since. Only later were confidential government files concerning Lawrence's career released, allowing the accuracy of Lawrence's own account to be gauged. Aldington's own reputation never fully recovered from what came to be seen as a venomous attack upon Lawrence's reputation. Many believed that Aldington's suffering in the bloodbath of Europe during the First World War caused him to resent Lawrence's reputation, gained in the Middle Eastern theatre. Robert Graves noted in a review of the book, \"instead of a carefully considered portrait of Lawrence, I find the self-portrait of a bitter, bedridden, leering, asthmatic, elderly hangman-of-letters.\"\nLast years\nAldington lived in Sury-en-Vaux, Cher, France, from 1958. His last significant book was a biography of the Proven\u00e7al poet and Nobel winner Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral (1956).Aldington died in Sury on 27 July 1962, shortly after being honoured in Moscow on the occasion of his seventieth birthday and the publication of some of his novels in Russian translation. His works became very popular in the USSR in his lifetime.   He is buried in the local cemetery in Sury. He left one daughter, Catherine, the child of his second marriage; she died in 2010. \nLegacy\nOn 11 November 1985 Aldington was among 16 Great War poets commemorated in stone at Westminster Abbey's Poet's Corner. The inscription on the stone is a quotation from the work of a fellow Great War poet, Wilfred Owen. It reads: \"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.\"\nStyle and bitterness\nAlec Waugh described Aldington as having been embittered by the war, but took it that he worked off his spleen in novels like The Colonel's Daughter (1931) rather than letting it poison his life. Douglas Bush describes his work as \"a career of disillusioned bitterness.\" His novels contained thinly veiled portraits of some of his friends, including Eliot, Lawrence and Pound; the friendship not always surviving. Lyndall Gordon characterises the sketch of Eliot in Aldington's memoirs Life for Life's Sake (1941) as 'snide'. As a young man, he was cutting about Yeats, but they remained on good terms.\nAldington's obituary in The Times of London in 1962 described him as \"[a]n angry young man of the generation before they became fashionable ... who remained something of an angry old man to the end\".\nBooks\nImages (1910\u20131915) The Poetry Bookshop, London (1915) & (historical reproduction by Bibliobazaar ISBN\u00a0978-1-113-27518-9) 2009\nImages Old and New Four Seas Co., Boston (1916) & (historical reproduction by Bibliobazaar ISBN\u00a0978-1-113-39283-1) 2009\nThe Poems of Anyte of Tegea (1916) translator\nImages of Desire (Elkin Mathews, 1919) & (historical reproduction by Bibliobazaar) ISBN\u00a0978-1-115-45071-3) 2009\nImages of War Beaumont Press, London (1919) & (historical reproduction by Bibliobazaar) ISBN\u00a0978-1-171-58428-5) 2009\nWar and Love: Poems 1915\u20131918 (1919)\nGreek Songs in the Manner of Anacreon (1919) translator\nA Book of 'Characters' from Theophrastus, Joseph Hall, Sir Thomas Overbury, Nicolas Breton, John Earle\nHymen (Egoist Press, 1921) with H.D.\nMedallions in Clay (1921)\nThe Good-Humoured Ladies: A Comedy by Carlo Goldoni (1922) translator, with Arthur Symons\nExile and Other Poems (1923)\nLiterary Studies and Reviews (1924) essays\nSturly, by Pierre Custot (1924) translator\nThe Mystery of the Nativity: Translated from the Liegeois of the XVth Century (Medici Society, 1924) translator\nA Fool i' the Forest: A Phantasmagoria (1924) poem\nVoltaire (1925)\nFrench Studies and Reviews (1926)\nThe Love of Myrrhine and Konallis: and other prose poems (1926)\nCyrano De Bergerac, Voyages to the Moon and the Sun (1927)\nD.H.

His elder sister was Edith Sitwell and his younger brother was Sacheverell Sitwell. Like them, he devoted his life to art and literature.\n\nEarly life\nSitwell was born on 6 December 1892 at 3 Arlington Street, St James's, London. His parents were Sir George Reresby Sitwell, fourth baronet, genealogist and antiquarian, and Lady Ida Emily Augusta (n\u00e9e Denison). He grew up in the family seat at Renishaw Hall, Derbyshire, and at Scarborough, and went to Ludgrove School, then Eton College from 1906 to 1909. For many years his entry in Who's Who contained the phrase \"Educ[ated]: during the holidays from Eton.\"In 1911 he joined the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry but, not cut out to be a cavalry officer, transferred to the Grenadier Guards at the Tower of London from where, in his off-duty time, he could frequent theatres and art galleries.\n\nArmy\nLate in 1914 Sitwell's civilised life was exchanged for the trenches of France near Ypres in Belgium. It was here that he wrote his first poetry, describing it as  \"Some instinct, and a combination of feelings not hitherto experienced united to drive me to paper\". \"Babel\" was published in The Times on 11 May 1916. In the same year, he began literary collaborations and anthologies with his brother and sister, the trio being usually referred to simply as the Sitwells.\n\nPolitical and other activity\nIn 1918 Sitwell left the Army with the rank of Captain, and contested the 1918 general election as the Liberal Party candidate for Scarborough and Whitby, finishing second.\n\nLater he moved towards the political right, though politics were very seldom explicit in his writings.  In Who's Who he ultimately declared of his political views: Advocates compulsory Freedom everywhere, the suppression of Public Opinion in the interest of Free Speech, and the rationing of brains without which innovation there can be no true democracy.Sitwell campaigned for the preservation of Georgian buildings and was responsible for saving Sutton Scarsdale Hall, now owned by English Heritage. He was an early and active member of the Georgian Group.He also had an interest in the paranormal and joined the Ghost Club, which at the time was being relaunched as a dinner society dedicated to discussing paranormal occurrences and topics.\nWriting career\nSitwell devoted himself to poetry, art criticism and controversial journalism. Together with his brother, he sponsored a controversial exhibition of works by Matisse, Utrillo, Picasso and Modigliani. The composer William Walton also greatly benefited from his largesse (though the two men afterwards fell out) and Walton's cantata Belshazzar's Feast was written to Sitwell's libretto. He published two books of poems: Argonaut and Juggernaut (1919) and At the House of Mrs Kinfoot (1921). In the mid-1920s he met David Stuart Horner (1900-1983) who was his lover and companion for most of his life.\nWorks\nSitwell's first work of fiction, Triple Fugue, was published in 1924, and visits to Italy and Germany produced Discursions on Travel, Art and Life (1925). His first novel, Before the Bombardment (1926), set in an out-of-season hotel, was well reviewed \u2013 Ralph Straus writing for Bystander magazine called it 'a nearly flawless piece of satirical writing', and Beverley Nichols praised 'the richness of its beauty and wit'. His subsequent novel The Man Who Lost Himself (1929) was an altogether different affair and did not receive the same critical acclaim. However, for Osbert Sitwell it was an attempt to take further the techniques that he had experimented with in his d\u00e9but, and he ventured to explain this in one challenging sentence in his Preface when he said: \"Convinced that movement is not in itself enough, that no particular action or sequence of actions is in itself of sufficient concern to dare lay claim to the intelligent attention of the reader, that adventures of the mind and soul are more interesting, because more mysterious, than those of the body, and yet that, on the other hand, the essence does not reside to any much greater degree in the tangle of reason, unreason, and previous history, in which each action, event and thought is founded, but is to be discovered, rather, in that balance, so difficult to achieve, which lies between them, he has attempted to write a book which might best be described as a Novel of Reasoned Action\". Re-edited over three quarters of a century after its initial publication, The Man Who Lost Himself has found new popularity as an idiosyncratic mystery novel.\nSitwell, sure in himself of the techniques he was exercising, went on to write several further novels, including Miracle on Sinai (1934) and Those Were the Days (1937) neither of which received the same glowing reviews as his first. A collection of short stories Open the Door (1940), his fifth novel A Place of One's Own (1940), his Selected Poems (1943) and a book of essays Sing High, Sing Low (1944) were reasonably well received. His \"The Four Continents\" (1951) is a book of travel, reminiscence and observation.\n\nRat Week\nSitwell was a close friend of the Duke and Duchess of York, future King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. In December 1936, when the abdication of King Edward VIII was announced, he wrote a poem, Rat Week, attacking principally the former king and Wallis Simpson but also those friends of Edward who deserted him when his alliance with Simpson became common knowledge in England. Because of its libellous content it was not published but Sitwell ensured that it was circulated privately. In February 1937, a version appeared in Cavalcade, which Sitwell described as a \"paper, which confounded liveliness with mischief\". The Cavalcade version omitted the \"offensive\" references to Edward and Wallis. This resulted in the poem's gaining an unwarranted reputation as being sympathetic to the Windsors over the way some of their friends had treated them. Cavalcade also missed out a verse in which a number of the \"rats\" were named explicitly, as to publish this would have been libellous.Sitwell sued Cavalcade for breach of copyright. He obtained an interim injunction preventing further publication in Cavalcade, which ensured further surreptitious circulation of the poem. When the full case came to court, Cavalcade tried to get Sitwell to produce the missing verse. Sitwell resisted on the grounds that he could not be forced to make a criminally libellous statement. The case ended up in the Appeal Court, where Sitwell won and obtained damages and costs.Sitwell knew that, because of the libel issue, the poem could not be published in his lifetime; he decided that publication should wait even longer than that to avoid \"pain to those still living\". The poem was first published posthumously in 1986 by Michael Joseph in a book entitled Rat Week: An Essay on the Abdication. Sitwell, in his essay, explained the background to the poem in some detail because he recognised that the long delay in publication would result in many readers being unfamiliar with the characters. The book also contains a foreword by John Pearson, explaining some of the background to the publication of the book.\nAutobiography\nIn 1943 he started an autobiography that ran to four volumes: Left Hand, Right Hand (1943), The Scarlet Tree (1946), Great Morning (1948) and Laughter in the Next Room (1949). Writing in The Adelphi, George Orwell declared that, \"although the range they cover is narrow, [they] must be among the best autobiographies of our time.\" Sitwell's autobiography was followed by a collection of essays about various people he had known, Noble Essences: A Book of Characters (1950), and a postscript, Tales my Father Taught Me (1962).\nThe sometimes acidic diarist James Agate commented on Sitwell after a drinking session on 3 June 1932, in Ego, volume 1, \"There is something self-satisfied and having-to-do-with-the-Bourbons about him which is annoying, though there is also something of the crowned-head consciousness which is disarming.\"\nIn Who's Who, he summed up his career: \"For the past 30 years has conducted, in conjunction with his brother and sister, a series of skirmishes and hand-to-hand battles against the Philistine.  Though outnumbered, has occasionally succeeded in denting the line, though not without damage to himself.\"\nBaronetcy\nAfter Sitwell's father died, in 1943, Osbert succeeded to the baronetcy.\n\nDeath\nSitwell suffered from Parkinson's disease from the 1950s; by the mid-1960s this condition had become so severe that he needed to abandon writing. He died on 4 May 1969 in Italy, at Montegufoni, a castle near Florence which his father had bought derelict in 1909 and restored as his personal residence.\nThe castle was left to his nephew, Reresby; his money was left to his brother Sachie. Sitwell was cremated and his ashes buried in the Cimitero Evangelico degli Allori in Florence, together with a copy of his first novel, Before the Bombardment.\nGallery of Montegufoni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect bibliography\nTriple Fugue (Stories) (1924)\nDiscursions on Travel, Art and Life (Essays) (1925)\nBefore the Bombardment (Novel) (1926)\nThe Man Who Lost Himself (Novel) (1929)\nCollected Poems and Satires (1931)\nWinters of Content, More Discursions on Travel, Art and Life (1932)\nDickens (1932)\nMiracles on Sina\u00ef (Novel) (1934)\nPenny Foolish: A Book of Tirades and Panegyrics (1935)\nThose Were the Days (Novel) (1937)\nA Place of One's Own (Novel) (1940)\nSelected Poems (1943)\nLeft Hand!

A lifelong communist, Gold was a novelist and literary critic. His semi-autobiographical novel Jews Without Money (1930) was a bestseller. During the 1930s and 1940s Gold was considered the preeminent author and editor of U.S. proletarian literature.\n\nBackground\nGold was born Itzok Isaac Granich on April 12, 1894, on the Lower East Side of New York City to Romanian Jewish immigrant parents, Chaim Granich and Gittel Schwartz Granich. He had two brothers, Max and George.\n\nCareer\nMike Gold published his first writings under the name Irwin Granich. He reportedly took the pseudonym Michael Gold at the time of the Palmer Raids on radicals in 1919-20 from a Jewish Civil War veteran whom he admired for having fought to \"free the slaves.\"The Masses, a socialist journal edited by Floyd Dell and Max Eastman, published his first pieces in August, 1914. \"Three Whose Hatred Killed Them\" is a poem about anarchists killed in a Lexington Avenue tenement by their own bomb. Gold praised their \"pure intentions\". Until his death he was an ardent supporter of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and of the Soviet Union in all its phases. In 1921-22 Gold and Claude McKay became Executive Editors of Max Eastman's magazine The Liberator. In 1922, Gold wrote: \"The Russian Bolsheviks will leave the world a better place than Jesus left it. They will leave it on the threshold of the final victory\u2014the poor will have bread and peace and culture in another generation, not churches and a swarm of lying parasite minister dogs, the legacy of Jesus.\"In 1925 Gold visited Moscow. In 1926 he was a founding editor of The New Masses, which published leftist works and also set up radical theater groups. Gold served as editor-in-chief from June 1928 until 1934. At both The Liberator and The New Masses, he favored publishing letters, poems and fiction by ordinary workers over works by literary leftists of bourgeois backgrounds.One of the widely noted articles he wrote for The New Masses was \"Gertrude Stein: A Literary Idiot\". Here he charged that her works \"resemble the monotonous gibberings of paranoiacs in the private wards of asylums ... The literary idiocy of Gertrude Stein only reflects the madness of the whole system of capitalist values. It is part of the signs of doom that are written largely everywhere on the walls of bourgeois society.\"\nIn \"Proletarian Realism\" (1930), Gold said of Marcel Proust: \"The worst example and the best of what we do not want to do is the spectacle of Proust, master-masturbator of the bourgeois literature.\" He also assailed the Pulitzer Prize winner Thornton Wilder in equally vitriolic terms.\nThroughout the 1920s Gold worked on his only novel, Jews Without Money, a fictionalized autobiography about growing up in the impoverished world of the Lower East Side. Published in 1930, shortly after the onset of the Great Depression, it was an immediate success and went through many print-runs in its first years and was translated into over 14 languages. It became a prototype for the American proletarian novel.  In his Author's Note to the novel, Gold wrote, \"I have told in my book a tale of Jewish poverty in one ghetto, that of New York. The same story can be of a hundred other ghettoes scattered over all the world. For centuries the Jew has lived in this universal ghetto.\"  The popularity of Jews Without Money made Gold a national figure and cultural commissar of the Communist Party. He was a daily columnist for its paper, the Daily Worker, until his death.  Gold himself was fond of repeating a quote from the novel: \"O workers' Revolution!... You are the true Messiah!\"As a critic, Gold fiercely denounced left-wing authors who he believed had deviated from the Communist Party line. Among those Gold denounced were screenwriter Albert Maltz and \"renegade\" Ernest Hemingway, who while never a Communist had been sympathetic to leftist causes but came under fire by some for his writing on the Spanish Civil War in For Whom the Bell Tolls. Hemingway responded with \"Go tell Mike Gold, Ernest Hemingway says he should go fuck himself.\" \nPersonal life and death\nGold was once romantically involved with Dorothy Day.Gold died in Terra Linda, California, on May 14, 1967, from complications following a stroke. He was 73 years old.\nLegacy\nGold's papers reside at the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives at New York University in New York City.Alice Neel painted Gold's portrait in 1952 and then again after his death.\nFootnotes\nWorks\nLife of John Brown.

An English professor at Vanderbilt University from 1920 to 1965, he was a founding member of the Fugitives and the overlapping group Southern Agrarians, two literary groups based in Nashville, Tennessee. He was a supporter of segregation in the United States.\n\nEarly life\nDavidson was born on August 8, 1893 in Campbellsville, Tennessee. His father, William Bluford Davidson, was \"a teacher and school administrator,\" and his mother, Elma Wells, was \"a music and elocution teacher.\" He had two brothers, John and William. Davidson received a classical education at Branham and Hughes Military Academy, a preparatory school in Spring Hill, Tennessee.  He earned both his bachelor's (1917) and master's (1922) degrees at Vanderbilt University. He served as a lieutenant in the United States Army during World War I.\nCareer\nDavidson was an English professor at Vanderbilt University from 1920 to 1965. While at Vanderbilt, Davidson became associated with the Fugitives, who met to read and criticize each other's verse. Later, they founded a review of the same name, which launched the literary careers of the poets and critics John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate and Robert Penn Warren, the poet Laura Riding, and the poet and psychiatrist Merrill Moore. He enjoyed a national reputation as a poet, in part due to the inclusion of his dramatic monologue, \"Lee in the Mountains\", in early editions of the influential college literature textbook Understanding Poetry.  Its editors were his former students Warren and Cleanth Brooks. From 1923 to 1930, Davidson reviewed books and edited the Nashville Tennessean book page, where he assessed more than 370 books.\nAround 1930, Davidson began his association with the Southern Agrarians. He was chiefly responsible for the decision of the group to write essays, published as the Agrarian manifesto I'll Take My Stand. Davidson shared the Agrarians' distaste for industrial capitalism and its destructive effect on American culture. Davidson's romantic outlook, however, led him to interpret Agrarianism as a straightforward politics of identity.  \"American\" identity had become \"characterless and synthetic,\" he argued in 1933. He encouraged Americans to embrace their identities as \"Rebels, Yankees, Westerners, New Englanders or what you will, bound by ties more generous than abstract institutions can express, rather than citizens of an Americanized nowhere, without family, kin, or home.\" He was in favor of segregation.In 1931, Davidson began a long association with Middlebury College's Breadloaf School of English. He bought a house in Vermont where he did much of his later writing. He taught at the Breadloaf School every summer until his death. In 1939 his textbook, American Composition and Rhetoric, was published and widely adopted for English courses in American universities.Perhaps most widely read today is Davidson's two-volume history: The Tennessee (1946 and 1948), in the Rivers of America series.  The second volume is notable for its critique of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the impact of its dam-building and eminent domain land seizure on local society. Although originally a supporter of the New Deal, he was suspicious that the TVA was a plot of northern business interests to exploit and dominate the South. He denounced the TVA as an instrument of political collectivism, run by outsiders, designed to destroy the South's traditions.In 1952 his ballad opera, Singin' Billy, with music by Charles F. Bryan, was performed at the Vanderbilt Theater. His work as book page editor for the Nashville Tennessean was commemorated in 1963 with the publication of The Spyglass: Views and Reviews, 1924\u20131930. A comprehensive collection of his poetry, Poems: 1922\u201361, was published in 1966.\nSegregationist political activism\nDavidson was a proponent of racial segregation and racial inequality. In an essay defending segregation in the Sewanee Review, described by Paul V. Murphy as his major work on the topic, he wrote: The white South denies the Negro equal participation in society, not only because it does not consider him entitled to equality, but because it is certain that social mingling would lead to biological mingling, which it is determined to prevent, both for any given contemporary generation and for its posterity.Davidson supported the 1948 presidential candidacy of Strom Thurmond, who was running as a Dixiecrat in opposition to President Harry Truman's civil rights proposals. He joined the Tennessee States' Rights Committee in 1950, and became the chairman of the Tennessee Federation for Constitutional Government (TFCG), the local analogue of the White Citizens Councils, at its founding in 1955. Under his leadership, TFCG led the failed effort to oppose the desegregation of Nashville's public schools. Davidson warned that if black students attended, \"The capital city of Tennessee would become an uneasy island of integration surrounded by a tumultuous ocean of protest and discontent.\"Personal life and death\nDavidson married Theresa Sherrer, a legal scholar and artist, in June 1918. They had a daughter, who married Eric Bell, Jr. They resided at 410 Fairfax Avenue in Nashville. He died on April 25, 1968, at age 72, at his home. He was buried at the Calvary Cemetery in Nashville.\nBibliography\nNovels\nThe Big Ballad Jamboree (1996, posthumous)Poetry\nAn Outland Piper (1924)\nThe Tall Men (1927)\nLee in the Mountains and Other Poems (1938)\nThe Long Street (1961)\nCollected Poems: 1922\u20131961 (1966)Opera\nSingin' Billy  (1952)Non-fiction\nI'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition (1930, co-author)\nAttack on Leviathan: Regionalism and Nationalism in the United States (1938)\nThe Tennessee (1946)\nRivers of America (1948)\nStill Rebels, Still Yankees (1957)\nSouthern Writers in the New World (1958)\nThe Spyglass: Views and Reviews, 1924\u20131930 (1963)References\nFurther reading\nMark Royden Winchell, Where No Flag Flies: Donald Davidson and the Southern Resistance, University of Missouri Press, Columbia, 2000.\n\n","137":"\n\nCharles Langbridge Morgan (22 January 1894 \u2013 6 February 1958) was a British playwright and novelist of English and Welsh parentage. The main themes of his work were, as he himself put it, \"Art, Love, and Death\", and the relation between them. Themes of individual novels range from the paradoxes of freedom (The Voyage, The River Line), through passionate love seen from within (Portrait in a Mirror) and without (A Breeze of Morning), to the conflict of good and evil (The Judge's Story) and the enchanted boundary of death (Sparkenbroke). He was the husband of Welsh novelist Hilda Vaughan.\n\nLife and writings\nEarly life\nHis maternal grandparents had emigrated to Australia from Pembrokeshire. His paternal grandparents were from Gloucestershire and Devon in England. His parents were married in Australia. His father, Sir Charles Langbridge Morgan, was a railway civil engineer, and at one time was President of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Morgan himself was born in Bromley, Kent. He was educated at the Naval Colleges of Osborne and Dartmouth and served as a midshipman in the China Fleet until 1913, when he returned to England to take the entrance examinations for Oxford. On the outbreak of war he rejoined the navy but was sent with Churchill's Naval Division to the defence of Antwerp. He was interned in the Netherlands which provided the setting for his best-selling novel The Fountain.\nSome of his early poems were published in The Westminster Gazette. \"To America\" (1917) was included in A Treasury of World Poetry, edited by George Herbert Clarke. After World War I, he took his degree at Brasenose College, Oxford.\n\nFamily relationships; journalism and drama\nAfter an unsuccessful relationship with Mary, a daughter of Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett, he married the Welsh novelist Hilda Vaughan in 1923.  They had two children: Dame Shirley Paget, Marchioness of Anglesey, and Roger Morgan, who became Librarian of the House of Lords Library. He was the drama critic of The Times from the 1920s until 1938, and contributed weekly articles on the London theatre to The New York Times.  He wrote a series of articles for The Times Literary Supplement under the byline \"Menander's Mirror\" from 1942, and many articles for The Sunday Times.\nHis first play, The Flashing Stream (1938), had successful runs in London and Paris but was not well received in New York. The River Line (1952) was originally written as a novel in 1949 and concerned the activities of escaped British prisoners of war in France during World War II.\n\nHonours and reputation\nHe was awarded the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1936, a promotion in 1945, and was elected a member of the Institut de France in 1949. From 1953 to 1956 he was the President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers.\nWhile Morgan enjoyed an immense reputation during his lifetime, particularly in France, and was awarded the 1940 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction, he was sometimes criticised for excessive seriousness, and for some time he was rather neglected; he once claimed that the \"sense of humour by which we are ruled avoids emotion and vision and grandeur of spirit as a weevil avoids the sun. It has banished tragedy from our theatre, eloquence from our debates, glory from our years of peace, splendour from our wars...\" The character Gerard Challis in Stella Gibbons's Westwood is thought to be a caricature of him. His posthumous reputation was initially higher in France than in Britain, but has begun a new rise in recent years with the republication of various novels (including Capuchin Classics' The Voyage with an Introduction by Oxford's Valentine Cunningham in 2009), his poetry (edited by Peter Holland for Scarthin Books in 2008) and an edition  of his plays published by Oberon Books in 2013. He was a consummate and committed stylist, from newspaper reviews to major novels a passionate craftsman of English prose. He was also very popular in Italy, especially in the 1950s. He spent long periods in the North, and in Tuscany. He wrote and set  in Lucca Sparkenbroke.\n\nLiterary connection\nMorgan employed Esm\u00e9 Valerie Fletcher as his private secretary when she moved to London from Leeds [1] in her determination to enter  London literary circles and find a way to meet T. S. Eliot, her future husband. She acknowledged her gratitude to Morgan for providing her with her first opportunity, and later spoke of her respect for him as an author in private discussions with her family and friends.\n\nMajor works\nNovels\nThe Gunroom (1919)\nMy Name is Legion (1925)\nPortrait in a Mirror (1929)\nThe Fountain (1932)\nSparkenbroke (1936)\nThe Voyage (1940)\nThe Empty Room (1941)\nThe Judge's Story (1947)\nThe River Line (1949)\nA Breeze of Morning (1951)\nChallenge to Venus (1957)Plays\nThe Flashing Stream (1938)\nThe River Line (1952)\nThe Burning Glass (1953)Essays\nEpitaph on George Moore (1935)\nThe House of Macmillan: (1843\u20131943) (1943)\nReflections in a Mirror (in two volumes 1944, 1946)\nLiberties of the Mind (1951)\nThe Writer and his World (1960)\nDramatic Critic: selected reviews (1922\u20131939), selected and edited by Roger Morgan (Oberon Books 2013)Poetry\nOde to France (1942)\nThe Collected Poems of Charles Morgan (2008)Quotations\n\"One cannot shut one's eyes to things not seen with eyes.\"\n\"There is no surprise more magical than the surprise of being loved.

A lifelong communist, Gold was a novelist and literary critic. His semi-autobiographical novel Jews Without Money (1930) was a bestseller. During the 1930s and 1940s Gold was considered the preeminent author and editor of U.S. proletarian literature.\n\nBackground\nGold was born Itzok Isaac Granich on April 12, 1894, on the Lower East Side of New York City to Romanian Jewish immigrant parents, Chaim Granich and Gittel Schwartz Granich. He had two brothers, Max and George.\n\nCareer\nMike Gold published his first writings under the name Irwin Granich. He reportedly took the pseudonym Michael Gold at the time of the Palmer Raids on radicals in 1919-20 from a Jewish Civil War veteran whom he admired for having fought to \"free the slaves.\"The Masses, a socialist journal edited by Floyd Dell and Max Eastman, published his first pieces in August, 1914. \"Three Whose Hatred Killed Them\" is a poem about anarchists killed in a Lexington Avenue tenement by their own bomb. Gold praised their \"pure intentions\". Until his death he was an ardent supporter of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and of the Soviet Union in all its phases. In 1921-22 Gold and Claude McKay became Executive Editors of Max Eastman's magazine The Liberator. In 1922, Gold wrote: \"The Russian Bolsheviks will leave the world a better place than Jesus left it. They will leave it on the threshold of the final victory\u2014the poor will have bread and peace and culture in another generation, not churches and a swarm of lying parasite minister dogs, the legacy of Jesus.\"In 1925 Gold visited Moscow. In 1926 he was a founding editor of The New Masses, which published leftist works and also set up radical theater groups. Gold served as editor-in-chief from June 1928 until 1934. At both The Liberator and The New Masses, he favored publishing letters, poems and fiction by ordinary workers over works by literary leftists of bourgeois backgrounds.One of the widely noted articles he wrote for The New Masses was \"Gertrude Stein: A Literary Idiot\". Here he charged that her works \"resemble the monotonous gibberings of paranoiacs in the private wards of asylums ... The literary idiocy of Gertrude Stein only reflects the madness of the whole system of capitalist values. It is part of the signs of doom that are written largely everywhere on the walls of bourgeois society.\"\nIn \"Proletarian Realism\" (1930), Gold said of Marcel Proust: \"The worst example and the best of what we do not want to do is the spectacle of Proust, master-masturbator of the bourgeois literature.\" He also assailed the Pulitzer Prize winner Thornton Wilder in equally vitriolic terms.\nThroughout the 1920s Gold worked on his only novel, Jews Without Money, a fictionalized autobiography about growing up in the impoverished world of the Lower East Side. Published in 1930, shortly after the onset of the Great Depression, it was an immediate success and went through many print-runs in its first years and was translated into over 14 languages. It became a prototype for the American proletarian novel.  In his Author's Note to the novel, Gold wrote, \"I have told in my book a tale of Jewish poverty in one ghetto, that of New York. The same story can be of a hundred other ghettoes scattered over all the world. For centuries the Jew has lived in this universal ghetto.\"  The popularity of Jews Without Money made Gold a national figure and cultural commissar of the Communist Party. He was a daily columnist for its paper, the Daily Worker, until his death.  Gold himself was fond of repeating a quote from the novel: \"O workers' Revolution!... You are the true Messiah!\"As a critic, Gold fiercely denounced left-wing authors who he believed had deviated from the Communist Party line. Among those Gold denounced were screenwriter Albert Maltz and \"renegade\" Ernest Hemingway, who while never a Communist had been sympathetic to leftist causes but came under fire by some for his writing on the Spanish Civil War in For Whom the Bell Tolls. Hemingway responded with \"Go tell Mike Gold, Ernest Hemingway says he should go fuck himself.\" \nPersonal life and death\nGold was once romantically involved with Dorothy Day.Gold died in Terra Linda, California, on May 14, 1967, from complications following a stroke. He was 73 years old.\nLegacy\nGold's papers reside at the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives at New York University in New York City.Alice Neel painted Gold's portrait in 1952 and then again after his death.\nFootnotes\nWorks\nLife of John Brown.

He was also a screenwriter and political activist. Among the enduring characters he created are Sam Spade (The Maltese Falcon), Nick and Nora Charles (The Thin Man), the Continental Op (Red Harvest and The Dain Curse) and the comic strip character Secret Agent X-9.\nHammett \"is now widely regarded as one of the finest mystery writers of all time\". In his obituary in The New York Times, he was described as \"the dean of the ... 'hard-boiled' school of detective fiction.\" Time included Hammett's 1929 novel Red Harvest on its list of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005. His novels and stories also had a significant influence on films, including the genres of private eye\/detective fiction, mystery thrillers, and film noir.\n\nEarly life\nHammett was born near Great Mills on the \"Hopewell and Aim\" farm in Saint Mary's County, Maryland, to Richard Thomas Hammett and his wife Anne Bond Dashiell. His mother belonged to an old Maryland family, whose name in French was De Chiel. He had an elder sister, Aronia, and a younger brother, Richard Jr. Known as Sam, Hammett was baptized a Catholic, and grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore.\nHe left school when he was 13 years old and held several jobs before working for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. He served as an operative for Pinkerton from 1915 to February 1922, with time off to serve in World War I. He said that while with the Pinkertons, he was sent to Butte, Montana, during the union strikes, though some researchers doubt this really happened. The agency's role in strike-breaking eventually left him disillusioned.Hammett enlisted in the United States Army in 1918 and served in the Motor Ambulance Corps. He was afflicted during that time with the Spanish flu and later contracted tuberculosis. He spent most of his time in the Army as a patient at Cushman Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, where he met a nurse, Josephine Dolan, whom he married on July 7, 1921, in San Francisco.\nMarriage and family\nHammett and Dolan had two daughters, Mary Jane (born 1921) and Josephine (born 1926). Shortly after the birth of their second child, health services nurses informed Dolan that, due to Hammett's tuberculosis, she and the children should not live with him full-time. Dolan rented a home in San Francisco, where Hammett would visit on weekends. The marriage soon fell apart; however, he continued to financially support his wife and daughters with the income he made from his writing.\nCareer and personal life\nHammett was first published in 1922 in the magazine The Smart Set. Known for the authenticity and realism of his writing, he drew on his experiences as a Pinkerton operative. Hammett wrote most of his detective fiction while he was living in San Francisco in the 1920s; streets and other locations in San Francisco are frequently mentioned in his stories. He said that \"I do take most of my characters from real life.\" His novels were some of the first to use dialogue that sounded authentic to the era. \"I distrust a man that says when. If he's got to be careful not to drink too much, it's because he's not to be trusted when he does.\"The bulk of his early work, featuring a nameless private investigator, The Continental Op, appeared in leading crime-fiction pulp magazine, Black Mask. Both Hammett and the magazine struggled in the period when Hammett became established.\nBecause of a disagreement with editor Philip C. Cody about money owed from previous stories, Hammett briefly stopped writing for Black Mask in 1926. He then took a full-time job as an advertisement copywriter for the Albert S. Samuels Co., a San Francisco jeweller.  He was wooed back to writing for the Black Mask by Joseph Thompson Shaw, who became the new editor in the summer of 1926. Hammett dedicated his first novel, Red Harvest, to Shaw and his second novel, The Dain Curse, to Samuels. Both these novels and his third, The Maltese Falcon, and fourth, The Glass Key,  were first serialized in Black Mask before being revised and edited for publication by Alfred A. Knopf. The Maltese Falcon, considered to be his best work, was voted No. 2 of  The Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time  by the Mystery Writers of America and is dedicated to his wife Josephine.\nFor much of 1929 and 1930, he was romantically involved with Nell Martin, a writer of short stories and several novels. He dedicated The Glass Key to her and, in turn, she dedicated her novel Lovers Should Marry to him. In 1931, Hammett embarked on a 30-year romantic relationship with the playwright Lillian Hellman. Though he sporadically continued to work on material, he wrote his final novel in 1934, more than 25 years before his death. The Thin Man is dedicated to Hellman. Why he moved away from fiction is not certain; Hellman speculated in a posthumous collection of Hammett's novels, \"I think, but I only think, I know a few of the reasons: he wanted to do new kind of work; he was sick for many of those years and getting sicker.\" In the 1940s, Hellman and he lived at her farm, Hardscrabble Farm, in Pleasantville, New York.Raymond Chandler, often considered Hammett's successor, summarized his accomplishments in The Simple Art of Murder:\n\nHammett was the ace performer, but there is nothing in his work that is not implicit in the early novels and short stories of Hemingway. Yet for all I know, Hemingway may have learned something from Hammett, as well as from writers like Dreiser, Ring Lardner, Carl Sandburg, Sherwood Anderson and himself ...\nHammett gave murder back to the kind of people that commit it for reasons, not just to provide a corpse; and with the means at hand, not with hand-wrought duelling pistols, curare, and tropical fish ... He is said to have lacked heart, yet the story he thought most of himself [The Glass Key] is the record of a man's devotion to a friend. He was spare, frugal, hard-boiled, but he did over and over again what only the best writers can ever do at all. He wrote scenes that seemed never to have been written before.\nPolitics and service in World War II\nHammett devoted much of his life to left-wing activism. He was a strong antifascist throughout the 1930s, and in 1937 joined the Communist Party. On May 1, 1935, Hammett joined the League of American Writers (1935-1943), whose members included Lillian Hellman, Alexander Trachtenberg of International Publishers, Frank Folsom, Louis Untermeyer, I. F. Stone, Myra Page, Millen Brand, Clifford Odets, and Arthur Miller. (Members were largely either Communist Party members or fellow travelers.) He suspended his anti-fascist activities when, as a member (and in 1941 president) of the League of American Writers, he served on its Keep America Out of War Committee in January 1940 during the period of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.Especially in Red Harvest, literary scholars have seen a Marxist critique of the social system. One Hammett biographer, Richard Layman, calls such interpretations \"imaginative\", but he nonetheless objects to them, since, among other reasons, no \"masses of politically dispossessed people\" are in this novel. Herbert Ruhm found that contemporary left-wing media already viewed Hammett's writing with skepticism, \"perhaps because his work suggests no solution: no mass-action ... no individual salvation ... no Emersonian reconciliation and transcendence\". In a letter of November 25, 1937, to his daughter Mary, Hammett referred to himself and others as \"we reds\". He confirmed, \"in a democracy all men are supposed to have an equal say in their government\", but added that \"their equality need not go beyond that.\" He also found, \"under socialism there is not necessarily ... any leveling of incomes.\"At the beginning of 1942, he wrote the screenplay of Watch on the Rhine, based on Hellman's successful play,  which received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay). But that year the Oscar went to Casablanca. In early 1942, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hammett again enlisted in the United States Army. He was a disabled veteran of World War I, a victim of tuberculosis, and a Communist, but he pulled strings to be admitted. However, biographer Diane Johnson suggests that confusion over Hammett's forenames was the reason he was able to re-enlist. He served as an enlisted man in the Aleutian Islands and initially worked on cryptanalysis on the island of Umnak. For fear of his radical tendencies, he was transferred to the Headquarters Company where he edited an Army newspaper entitled The Adakian. In 1943, while still a member of the military, he co-authored The Battle of the Aleutians with Cpl. Robert Colodny, under the direction of an infantry intelligence officer, Major Henry W. Hall. While in the Aleutians, he developed emphysema.After the war, Hammett returned to political activism, \"but he played that role with less fervour than before\". He was elected president of the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) on June 5, 1946, at a meeting held at the Hotel Diplomat in New York City, and \"devoted the largest portion of his working time to CRC activities\".In 1946, a bail fund was created by the CRC \"to be used at the discretion of three trustees to gain the release of defendants arrested for political reasons.\" Those three trustees were Hammett, who was chairman, Robert W. Dunn, and Frederick Vanderbilt Field, \"millionaire Communist supporter.\" On April 3, 1947, the CRC was identified as a Communist front group on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations, as directed by U.S. President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9835.\nImprisonment and the blacklist\nThe CRC's bail fund gained national attention on November 4, 1949, when bail in the amount of \"$260,000 in negotiable government bonds\" was posted \"to free eleven men appealing their convictions under the Smith Act for criminal conspiracy to teach and advocate the overthrow of the United States government by force and violence.\" On July 2, 1951, their appeals exhausted, four of the convicted men fled rather than surrender themselves to federal agents and begin serving their sentences. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued subpoenas to the trustees of the CRC bail fund in an attempt to learn the whereabouts of the fugitives.Hammett testified on July 9, 1951, in front of United States District Court Judge Sylvester Ryan, facing questioning by Irving Saypol, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, described by Time as \"the nation's number-one legal hunter of top Communists\". During the hearing, Hammett refused to provide the information the government wanted, specifically the list of contributors to the bail fund, \"people who might be sympathetic enough to harbor the fugitives.\" Instead, on every question regarding the CRC or the bail fund, Hammett declined to answer, citing the Fifth Amendment, refusing to even identify his signature or initials on CRC documents the government had subpoenaed. As soon as his testimony concluded, Hammett was found guilty of contempt of court.Hammett served time in a West Virginia federal penitentiary, where, according to Lillian Hellman, he was assigned to clean toilets. Hellman noted in her eulogy of Hammett that he submitted to prison rather than reveal the names of the contributors to the fund because \"he had come to the conclusion that a man should keep his word.\"By 1952, Hammett's popularity had declined as result of the hearings. He found himself impoverished due a combination of the cancellation of radio programs The Adventures of Sam Spade and The Adventures of the Thin Man, and a lien on his income by the Internal Revenue Service for back taxes owed since 1943. Furthermore, his books were no longer in print.\nLater years and death\nDuring the 1950s, Hammett was investigated by Congress. He testified on March 26, 1953, before the House Un-American Activities Committee about his own activities, but refused to cooperate with the committee. No official action was taken, but his stand led to him being blacklisted, along with others who were blacklisted as a result of McCarthyism.\nHammett became an alcoholic before working in advertising, and alcoholism continued to trouble him until 1948, when he quit under doctor's orders. However, years of heavy drinking and smoking worsened the tuberculosis he contracted in World War I, and then, according to Hellman, \"jail had made a thin man thinner, a sick man sicker\u00a0... I knew he would now always be sick.\"Hellman wrote that during the 1950s, Hammett became \"a hermit\", his decline evident in the clutter of his rented \"ugly little country cottage\", where \"signs of sickness were all around: now the phonograph was unplayed, the typewriter untouched, the beloved foolish gadgets unopened in their packages.\" He may have meant to start a new literary life with the novel Tulip, but left it unfinished, perhaps because he was \"just too ill to care, too worn out to listen to plans or read contracts. The fact of breathing, just breathing, took up all the days and nights.\" Hammett could no longer live alone, and they both knew it, so he spent the last four years of his life with Hellman. \"Not all of that time was easy, and some of it very bad\", she wrote, but, \"guessing death was not too far away, I would try for something to have afterwards.\"\nHammett died in Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on January 10, 1961, of lung cancer, diagnosed just two months before.\nA veteran of both world wars, Hammett was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\nArchive\nMany of Hammett's papers are held by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. This archive includes manuscripts and personal correspondence, along with a small group of miscellaneous notes.The Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at the University of South Carolina holds the Dashiell Hammett family papers.\nLegacy\nHammett's relationship with Lillian Hellman was portrayed in the 1977 film Julia. Jason Robards won an Oscar for his depiction of Hammett, and Jane Fonda was nominated for her portrayal of Lillian Hellman.\nHammett was the subject of a 1982 prime time PBS biography, The Case of Dashiell Hammett, that won a Peabody Award and a special Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America.Frederic Forrest portrayed Hammett semifictionally as the protagonist in the 1982 film Hammett, based on the novel of the same name by Joe Gores.\nSam Shepard played Hammett in the 1999 Emmy-nominated biographical television film Dash and Lilly along with Judy Davis as Hellman.\n\nBibliography\nSeries\nThe Continental Op\n\nSam Spade\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (initially a 5 part serial from September 1929 to January 1930 in Black Mask)\n\"A Man Called Spade\" (July, 1932, The American Magazine; also collected in A Man Called Spade and Other Stories)\n\"Too Many Have Lived\" (October, 1932, The American Magazine; also collected in A Man Called Spade and Other Stories)\n\"They Can Only Hang You Once\" (November 19, 1932, Colliers; also in A Man Called Spade and Other Stories)\n\"A Knife Will Cut for Anybody\" (Unpublished - posthumously published in 2013)Nick and Nora Charles\n\nThe First Thin Man (November 4, 1975, City Magazine)\nThe Thin Man (January 8, 1934)\nAfter the Thin Man (September 17, 1935)\nAnother Thin Man (May 13, 1938)\n\"Sequel to the Thin Man\" (December 7, 1938)Other short stories\nNovels\nRed Harvest (New York & London: Alfred A.

He was also a screenwriter and political activist. Among the enduring characters he created are Sam Spade (The Maltese Falcon), Nick and Nora Charles (The Thin Man), the Continental Op (Red Harvest and The Dain Curse) and the comic strip character Secret Agent X-9.\nHammett \"is now widely regarded as one of the finest mystery writers of all time\". In his obituary in The New York Times, he was described as \"the dean of the ... 'hard-boiled' school of detective fiction.\" Time included Hammett's 1929 novel Red Harvest on its list of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005. His novels and stories also had a significant influence on films, including the genres of private eye\/detective fiction, mystery thrillers, and film noir.\n\nEarly life\nHammett was born near Great Mills on the \"Hopewell and Aim\" farm in Saint Mary's County, Maryland, to Richard Thomas Hammett and his wife Anne Bond Dashiell. His mother belonged to an old Maryland family, whose name in French was De Chiel. He had an elder sister, Aronia, and a younger brother, Richard Jr. Known as Sam, Hammett was baptized a Catholic, and grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore.\nHe left school when he was 13 years old and held several jobs before working for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. He served as an operative for Pinkerton from 1915 to February 1922, with time off to serve in World War I. He said that while with the Pinkertons, he was sent to Butte, Montana, during the union strikes, though some researchers doubt this really happened. The agency's role in strike-breaking eventually left him disillusioned.Hammett enlisted in the United States Army in 1918 and served in the Motor Ambulance Corps. He was afflicted during that time with the Spanish flu and later contracted tuberculosis. He spent most of his time in the Army as a patient at Cushman Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, where he met a nurse, Josephine Dolan, whom he married on July 7, 1921, in San Francisco.\nMarriage and family\nHammett and Dolan had two daughters, Mary Jane (born 1921) and Josephine (born 1926). Shortly after the birth of their second child, health services nurses informed Dolan that, due to Hammett's tuberculosis, she and the children should not live with him full-time. Dolan rented a home in San Francisco, where Hammett would visit on weekends. The marriage soon fell apart; however, he continued to financially support his wife and daughters with the income he made from his writing.\nCareer and personal life\nHammett was first published in 1922 in the magazine The Smart Set. Known for the authenticity and realism of his writing, he drew on his experiences as a Pinkerton operative. Hammett wrote most of his detective fiction while he was living in San Francisco in the 1920s; streets and other locations in San Francisco are frequently mentioned in his stories. He said that \"I do take most of my characters from real life.\" His novels were some of the first to use dialogue that sounded authentic to the era. \"I distrust a man that says when. If he's got to be careful not to drink too much, it's because he's not to be trusted when he does.\"The bulk of his early work, featuring a nameless private investigator, The Continental Op, appeared in leading crime-fiction pulp magazine, Black Mask. Both Hammett and the magazine struggled in the period when Hammett became established.\nBecause of a disagreement with editor Philip C. Cody about money owed from previous stories, Hammett briefly stopped writing for Black Mask in 1926. He then took a full-time job as an advertisement copywriter for the Albert S. Samuels Co., a San Francisco jeweller.  He was wooed back to writing for the Black Mask by Joseph Thompson Shaw, who became the new editor in the summer of 1926. Hammett dedicated his first novel, Red Harvest, to Shaw and his second novel, The Dain Curse, to Samuels. Both these novels and his third, The Maltese Falcon, and fourth, The Glass Key,  were first serialized in Black Mask before being revised and edited for publication by Alfred A. Knopf. The Maltese Falcon, considered to be his best work, was voted No. 2 of  The Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time  by the Mystery Writers of America and is dedicated to his wife Josephine.\nFor much of 1929 and 1930, he was romantically involved with Nell Martin, a writer of short stories and several novels. He dedicated The Glass Key to her and, in turn, she dedicated her novel Lovers Should Marry to him. In 1931, Hammett embarked on a 30-year romantic relationship with the playwright Lillian Hellman. Though he sporadically continued to work on material, he wrote his final novel in 1934, more than 25 years before his death. The Thin Man is dedicated to Hellman. Why he moved away from fiction is not certain; Hellman speculated in a posthumous collection of Hammett's novels, \"I think, but I only think, I know a few of the reasons: he wanted to do new kind of work; he was sick for many of those years and getting sicker.\" In the 1940s, Hellman and he lived at her farm, Hardscrabble Farm, in Pleasantville, New York.Raymond Chandler, often considered Hammett's successor, summarized his accomplishments in The Simple Art of Murder:\n\nHammett was the ace performer, but there is nothing in his work that is not implicit in the early novels and short stories of Hemingway.

He wrote scenes that seemed never to have been written before.\nPolitics and service in World War II\nHammett devoted much of his life to left-wing activism. He was a strong antifascist throughout the 1930s, and in 1937 joined the Communist Party. On May 1, 1935, Hammett joined the League of American Writers (1935-1943), whose members included Lillian Hellman, Alexander Trachtenberg of International Publishers, Frank Folsom, Louis Untermeyer, I. F. Stone, Myra Page, Millen Brand, Clifford Odets, and Arthur Miller. (Members were largely either Communist Party members or fellow travelers.) He suspended his anti-fascist activities when, as a member (and in 1941 president) of the League of American Writers, he served on its Keep America Out of War Committee in January 1940 during the period of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.Especially in Red Harvest, literary scholars have seen a Marxist critique of the social system.

In 1943, while still a member of the military, he co-authored The Battle of the Aleutians with Cpl. Robert Colodny, under the direction of an infantry intelligence officer, Major Henry W. Hall. While in the Aleutians, he developed emphysema.After the war, Hammett returned to political activism, \"but he played that role with less fervour than before\". He was elected president of the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) on June 5, 1946, at a meeting held at the Hotel Diplomat in New York City, and \"devoted the largest portion of his working time to CRC activities\".In 1946, a bail fund was created by the CRC \"to be used at the discretion of three trustees to gain the release of defendants arrested for political reasons.\" Those three trustees were Hammett, who was chairman, Robert W. Dunn, and Frederick Vanderbilt Field, \"millionaire Communist supporter.\" On April 3, 1947, the CRC was identified as a Communist front group on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations, as directed by U.S. President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9835.\nImprisonment and the blacklist\nThe CRC's bail fund gained national attention on November 4, 1949, when bail in the amount of \"$260,000 in negotiable government bonds\" was posted \"to free eleven men appealing their convictions under the Smith Act for criminal conspiracy to teach and advocate the overthrow of the United States government by force and violence.\" On July 2, 1951, their appeals exhausted, four of the convicted men fled rather than surrender themselves to federal agents and begin serving their sentences. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued subpoenas to the trustees of the CRC bail fund in an attempt to learn the whereabouts of the fugitives.Hammett testified on July 9, 1951, in front of United States District Court Judge Sylvester Ryan, facing questioning by Irving Saypol, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, described by Time as \"the nation's number-one legal hunter of top Communists\". During the hearing, Hammett refused to provide the information the government wanted, specifically the list of contributors to the bail fund, \"people who might be sympathetic enough to harbor the fugitives.\" Instead, on every question regarding the CRC or the bail fund, Hammett declined to answer, citing the Fifth Amendment, refusing to even identify his signature or initials on CRC documents the government had subpoenaed. As soon as his testimony concluded, Hammett was found guilty of contempt of court.Hammett served time in a West Virginia federal penitentiary, where, according to Lillian Hellman, he was assigned to clean toilets. Hellman noted in her eulogy of Hammett that he submitted to prison rather than reveal the names of the contributors to the fund because \"he had come to the conclusion that a man should keep his word.\"By 1952, Hammett's popularity had declined as result of the hearings. He found himself impoverished due a combination of the cancellation of radio programs The Adventures of Sam Spade and The Adventures of the Thin Man, and a lien on his income by the Internal Revenue Service for back taxes owed since 1943. Furthermore, his books were no longer in print.\nLater years and death\nDuring the 1950s, Hammett was investigated by Congress. He testified on March 26, 1953, before the House Un-American Activities Committee about his own activities, but refused to cooperate with the committee. No official action was taken, but his stand led to him being blacklisted, along with others who were blacklisted as a result of McCarthyism.\nHammett became an alcoholic before working in advertising, and alcoholism continued to trouble him until 1948, when he quit under doctor's orders. However, years of heavy drinking and smoking worsened the tuberculosis he contracted in World War I, and then, according to Hellman, \"jail had made a thin man thinner, a sick man sicker\u00a0... I knew he would now always be sick.\"Hellman wrote that during the 1950s, Hammett became \"a hermit\", his decline evident in the clutter of his rented \"ugly little country cottage\", where \"signs of sickness were all around: now the phonograph was unplayed, the typewriter untouched, the beloved foolish gadgets unopened in their packages.\" He may have meant to start a new literary life with the novel Tulip, but left it unfinished, perhaps because he was \"just too ill to care, too worn out to listen to plans or read contracts. The fact of breathing, just breathing, took up all the days and nights.\" Hammett could no longer live alone, and they both knew it, so he spent the last four years of his life with Hellman. \"Not all of that time was easy, and some of it very bad\", she wrote, but, \"guessing death was not too far away, I would try for something to have afterwards.\"\nHammett died in Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on January 10, 1961, of lung cancer, diagnosed just two months before.\nA veteran of both world wars, Hammett was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\nArchive\nMany of Hammett's papers are held by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. This archive includes manuscripts and personal correspondence, along with a small group of miscellaneous notes.The Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at the University of South Carolina holds the Dashiell Hammett family papers.\nLegacy\nHammett's relationship with Lillian Hellman was portrayed in the 1977 film Julia. Jason Robards won an Oscar for his depiction of Hammett, and Jane Fonda was nominated for her portrayal of Lillian Hellman.\nHammett was the subject of a 1982 prime time PBS biography, The Case of Dashiell Hammett, that won a Peabody Award and a special Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America.Frederic Forrest portrayed Hammett semifictionally as the protagonist in the 1982 film Hammett, based on the novel of the same name by Joe Gores.\nSam Shepard played Hammett in the 1999 Emmy-nominated biographical television film Dash and Lilly along with Judy Davis as Hellman.\n\nBibliography\nSeries\nThe Continental Op\n\nSam Spade\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (initially a 5 part serial from September 1929 to January 1930 in Black Mask)\n\"A Man Called Spade\" (July, 1932, The American Magazine; also collected in A Man Called Spade and Other Stories)\n\"Too Many Have Lived\" (October, 1932, The American Magazine; also collected in A Man Called Spade and Other Stories)\n\"They Can Only Hang You Once\" (November 19, 1932, Colliers; also in A Man Called Spade and Other Stories)\n\"A Knife Will Cut for Anybody\" (Unpublished - posthumously published in 2013)Nick and Nora Charles\n\nThe First Thin Man (November 4, 1975, City Magazine)\nThe Thin Man (January 8, 1934)\nAfter the Thin Man (September 17, 1935)\nAnother Thin Man (May 13, 1938)\n\"Sequel to the Thin Man\" (December 7, 1938)Other short stories\nNovels\nRed Harvest (New York & London: Alfred A.

Most of his stories revolved around a young protagonist, Joseph Todhunter (\"Tod\") Moran, who shipped out on tramp freighters during the interwar years.\nLife\nPease was born in Stockton on September 6, 1894. For most of his life he resided in the San Francisco, California, area, except for those times when he shipped out as a member of the crew on a freighter, searching for new material.Pease decided to become a writer while in the sixth grade, and he wrote his first short story in 1907 during that school year. He attended Stanford University in Stanford, California, interrupted his studies for two years of United States Army service in Europe, then returned to graduate. During two summers, he shipped out as a wiper in the engine room of a cargo ship.Pease's first published work was a short story that appeared in the June 1921 edition of the children's magazine The American Boy.  He wrote his first novel, The Gypsy Caravan, in the early 1920s, although it was not published until 1930, when it became his fourth published novel. His first published novel was The Tattooed Man, based on two of his voyages and on a walking trip he took along the south coast of France from Marseilles to Italy; it appeared in 1926, and introduced Tod Moran, a young merchant mariner who is the protagonist in most of Pease's novels, working his way up from wiper to first mate as the novels \u2013 sometimes referred to as \"the Tod Moran mysteries\" \u2013 progress. Recurring characters in the Tod Moran novels are his friends in the \"black gang\" (slang for the engine room crew), Toppy, a Cockney deckhand, and Sven, a Swede, as well as Captain Jarvis, master of the freighter Araby and a father figure to Tod.By the late 1930s, Pease had written The Gypsy Caravan, Secret Cargo, and eight Tod Moran novels. He wanted to branch out beyond the creative constraints imposed by the Tod Moran series, but his editor at Doubleday insisted that he continue to write Tod Moran books exclusively. In response, he wrote Captain Binnacle and The Long Wharf, leading her to relent and allow him to write more on topics others than the adventures of Tod Moran. However, he continued the Tod Moran series as well; indeed, the last of his 22 published novels, Mystery on Telegraph Hill, was a Tod Moran mystery published in 1961.In addition to writing children's stories, Pease taught high school English and in the  mid-1940s was the principal at Los Altos Elementary School. He also contributed to journals and reviewed books for The New York Times.\nPease died in San Rafael, California, on April 14, 1974. He is buried at Stockton Rural Cemetery in Stockton.\nInfluence\nPhilip Roth, Russell Freedman, Michael Dirda and E. L. Doctorow all cited Pease's stories as childhood influences. Reflected Dirda: \"For a long period also I sought out the work of Howard Pease, old-fashioned nautical adventures teeming with frequent and arcane allusions to bilge, Lascars, and fo'csles.\" Freedman, who won the Newbery Medal and valued realism and accuracy in children's writing, called Pease his \"literary hero.\"\nPease and children's literature\nPease was strongly critical of the 1930s world of children's literature (in which he worked) which he stated was a \"wholly and solely a woman's world\u2014a completely feminine world\" subject to \"tender-minded feminine control.\" Pease believed that this resulted in a paucity of male authors, depressed wages and a lack of realism in children's stories. Pease expounded these views in an address he delivered in 1939 at an American Library Association \"pre-conference\" moderated by Frances Clarke Sayers. While the audience of 400 female librarians concurred with Pease that the lack of male authors and of social realism was a problem, his overall misogynistic tone offended many and damaged his case. Nevertheless, Pease's speech provoked discussion in the field and led to, among other things, a review of the criteria by which the Newbery Medal winner was selected. Pease remained interested in the question of realism in children's literature and corresponded with other authors on the topic, including noted librarian Julia Sauer. In a reversal, a modern critic took Pease to task for creating \"traditional\" male heroes who were \"brave, clever and independent.\"\nAwards\nPease received two literary awards during his life. In 1944, he received the California Commonwealth Book Award for his novel Thunderbolt House, published that year, and in 1946 he was awarded the Children's Book Award from the Children's Book Committee at Bank Street College of Education \"for a book that deals realistically with problems in the child's world\" for his novel Heart of Danger of that year.\nPapers\nPease's papers are held at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California.\n\nBibliography\nThe Tattooed Man (1926) \u2013  \"A fantastic cook adds to the excitement of Tod Moran's trip on a freighter from San Francisco to the Mediterranean\" (from the series' dust jacket).\nThe Jinx Ship (1927) \u2013 The tramp steamer Congo lives up to her sinister reputation when Tod Moran defies sailor superstition to ship as a wiper.\nShanghai Passage (1929) \u2013 Mutiny, mystery, and revolution on a tramp steamer bound for the China coast.

Many of his plays are structured around a time slip, and he went on to develop a new theory of time, with different dimensions that link past, present, and future.\nIn 1940, he broadcast a series of short propaganda radio talks that were credited with strengthening civilian morale during the Battle of Britain. In the following years, his left-wing beliefs brought him into conflict with the government and influenced the development of the welfare state.\n\nEarly years\nPriestley was born on 13 September 1894 at 34 Mannheim Road, Manningham, which he described as an \"extremely respectable\" suburb of Bradford.\nHis father Jonathan Priestley (1868\u20131924) was a headmaster. His mother Emma (nee Holt) (1865\u20131896) died when he was just two years old, and his father remarried four years later. Priestley was educated at Belle Vue Grammar School, which he left at sixteen to work as a junior clerk at Helm & Co., a wool firm in the Swan Arcade. During his years at Helm & Co. (1910\u20131914), he started writing at night and had articles published in local and London newspapers. He was to draw on memories of Bradford in many of the works he wrote after he had moved south, including Bright Day and When We Are Married. As an old man, he deplored the destruction by developers of Victorian buildings in Bradford such as the Swan Arcade, where he had his first job.\nPriestley served in the British army during the First World War, volunteering for the Duke of Wellington's Regiment on 7 September 1914, and being posted to the 10th Battalion in France as a Lance-Corporal on 26 August 1915. He was badly wounded in June 1916, when he was buried alive by a trench mortar. He spent many months in military hospitals and convalescent establishments, and on 26 January 1918 was commissioned as an officer in the Devonshire Regiment and posted back to France late summer 1918. As he describes in his literary reminiscences, Margin Released, he suffered from the effects of poison gas, and then supervised German prisoners of war, before being demobilised in early 1919.\nAfter his military service, Priestley received a university education at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. By the age of 30, he had established a reputation as an essayist and critic. His novel Benighted (1927) was adapted into the James Whale film The Old Dark House (1932); the novel has been published under the film's name in the United States.\n\nCareer\nPriestley's first major success came with a novel, The Good Companions (1929), which earned him the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction and made him a national figure. His next novel, Angel Pavement (1930), further established him as a successful novelist. However, some critics were less than complimentary about his work, and Priestley threatened legal action against Graham Greene for what he took to be a defamatory portrait of him in the novel Stamboul Train (1932).\nIn 1934 he published the travelogue English Journey, an account of what he saw and heard while travelling through the country in the depths of the Great Depression.Priestley is today seen as having a prejudice against the Irish, as is shown in his work, English Journey: \"A  great many speeches have been made and books written on the subject of what England has done to Ireland... I should be interested to hear a speech and read a book or two on the subject of what Ireland has done to England... if we do have an Irish Republic as our neighbour, and it is found possible to return her exiled citizens, what a grand clearance there will be in all the western ports, from the Clyde to Cardiff, what a fine exit of ignorance and dirt and drunkenness and disease.\"\nHe moved into a new genre and became equally well known as a dramatist. Dangerous Corner (1932) was the first of many plays that would enthral West End theatre audiences. His best-known play is An Inspector Calls (1945). His plays are more varied in tone than the novels, several being influenced by J. W. Dunne's theory of time, which plays a part in the plots of Dangerous Corner (1932) and Time and the Conways.\nIn 1940, Priestley wrote an essay for Horizon magazine, where he criticised George Bernard Shaw for his support of Stalin: \"Shaw presumes that his friend Stalin has everything under control. Well, Stalin may have made special arrangements to see that Shaw comes to no harm, but the rest of us in Western Europe do not feel quite so sure of our fate, especially those of us who do not share Shaw's curious admiration for dictators.\"During the Second World War, he was a regular broadcaster on the BBC. The Postscript, broadcast on Sunday night through 1940 and again in 1941, drew peak audiences of 16 million; only Churchill was more popular with listeners. Graham Greene wrote that Priestley \"became in the months after Dunkirk a leader second only in importance to Mr. Churchill. And he gave us what our other leaders have always failed to give us \u2013 an ideology.\" But his talks were cancelled. It was thought that this was the effect of complaints from Churchill that they were too left-wing; however, in 2015 Priestley's son said in a talk on the latest book being published about his father's life that it was in fact Churchill's Cabinet that brought about the cancellation by supplying negative reports on the broadcasts to Churchill.Priestley chaired the 1941 Committee, and in 1942 he was a co-founder of the socialist Common Wealth Party. The political content of his broadcasts and his hopes of a new and different Britain after the war influenced the politics of the period and helped the Labour Party gain its landslide victory in the 1945 general election. Priestley himself, however, was distrustful of the state and dogma, though he did stand for the Cambridge University constituency in 1945.\nPriestley's name was on Orwell's list, a list of people which George Orwell prepared in March 1949 for the Information Research Department (IRD), a propaganda unit set up at the Foreign Office by the Labour government. Orwell considered or suspected these people to have pro-communist leanings and therefore to be unsuitable to write for the IRD.He was a founding member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in 1958.\nIn 1960, Priestley published Literature and Western Man, a 500-page survey of Western literature in all its genres from the second half of the 15th\u00a0century to the present (the last author discussed is Thomas Wolfe).\nHis interest in the problem of time led him to publish an extended essay in 1964 under the title of Man and Time (Aldus published this as a companion to Carl Jung's Man and His Symbols). In this book he explored in depth various theories and beliefs about time as well as his own research and unique conclusions, including an analysis of the phenomenon of precognitive dreaming, based in part on a broad sampling of experiences gathered from the British public, who responded enthusiastically to a televised appeal he made while being interviewed in 1963 on the BBC programme, Monitor.\n\nThe University of Bradford awarded Priestley the title of honorary Doctor of Letters in 1970, and he was awarded the Freedom of the City of Bradford in 1973. His connections with the city were also marked by the naming of the J. B. Priestley Library at the University of Bradford, which he officially opened in 1975, and by the larger-than-life statue of him, commissioned by the Bradford City Council after his death, and which now stands in front of the National Media Museum.\nPersonal life\nPriestley had a deep love for classical music, especially chamber music. This love is reflected in a number of Priestley's works, notably his own favourite novel Bright Day (Heinemann, 1946). His book Trumpets Over the Sea is subtitled \"a rambling and egotistical account of the London Symphony Orchestra's engagement at Daytona Beach, Florida, in July\u2013August 1967\".In 1941 he played an important part in organising and supporting a fund-raising campaign on behalf of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, which was struggling to establish itself as a self-governing body after the withdrawal of Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1949 the opera The Olympians by Arthur Bliss, to a libretto by Priestley, was premiered.\nPriestley snubbed the chance to become a life peer in 1965 and also declined appointment as a Companion of Honour in 1969. But he did become a member of the Order of Merit in 1977. He also served as a British delegate to UNESCO conferences.\n\nMarriages\nPriestley was married three times. He also had a number of affairs, including a serious relationship with the actress Peggy Ashcroft. Writing in 1972, Priestley described himself as 'lusty' and as one who has 'enjoyed the physical relations with the sexes \u2026 without the feelings of guilt which seems to disturb some of my distinguished colleagues'.In 1921, Priestley married Emily \"Pat\" Tempest, a music-loving Bradford librarian. Two daughters were born, Barbara (later known as the architect Barbara Wykeham) in 1923 and Sylvia (a designer known as Sylvia Goaman following her marriage to Michael Goaman) in 1924, but in 1925 his wife died of cancer.In September 1926, Priestley married Jane Wyndham-Lewis (ex-wife of the one-time 'Beachcomber' columnist D. B. Wyndham-Lewis, no relation to the artist Wyndham Lewis); they had two daughters (including music therapist Mary Priestley, conceived while Jane was still married to D. B. Wyndham-Lewis) and one son. During the Second World War, Jane ran several residential nurseries for evacuated mothers and their children, many of whom had come from poor districts.In 1953, Priestley divorced his second wife then married the archaeologist and writer Jacquetta Hawkes, with whom he collaborated on the play Dragon's Mouth. The couple lived at Alveston, Warwickshire, near Stratford-upon-Avon later in his life.\n\nDeath\nPriestley died of pneumonia on 14 August 1984.His ashes were buried in Hubberholme Churchyard, at the head of Wharfedale in Yorkshire. The exact location of his ashes has never been made public and was only known to the three people present. A plaque in the church just states that his ashes are buried 'nearby'. Three photographs exist, showing the ashes being interred, and were taken by Dr. Brian Hoyle Thompson who, along with his wife, were two of the three people present. The brass plate on the box containing the ashes reads J. B. Priestley and can be seen clearly in one of the pictures.\nArchive\nPriestley began placing his papers at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 1960, with additions being made throughout his lifetime. The Center has continued to add to the collection through gifts and purchases when possible. The collection currently amounts to roughly 23 boxes, and includes original manuscripts for many of his works and an extensive series of correspondence.\nBibliography\nNovels\nAdam in Moonshine (1927)\nBenighted (1927) (filmed as The Old Dark House)\nThe Good Companions (1929)\nAngel Pavement (1930)\nFaraway (1932)\nWonder Hero (1933)\nAlbert Goes Through (1933)\nThey Walk in the City (1936)\nThe Doomsday Men (1937)\nLet the People Sing (1939)\nBlackout in Gretley (1942)\nDaylight on Saturday (1943)\nThree Men in New Suits (1945)\nBright Day (1946)\nJenny Villiers (1947)\nFestival at Farbridge (1951)\nLow Notes on a High Level (1954)\nThe Magicians (1954)\nSaturn over the Water (1961)\nThe Thirty-First of June (1961)\nSalt Is Leaving (1961)\nThe Shapes of Sleep (1962)\nSir Michael and Sir George (1964)\nLost Empires (1965)\nIt's an Old Country (1967)\nThe Image Men Vol. 1: Out of Town (1968)\nThe Image Men Vol. 2: London End (1968)\nFound, Lost, Found (1976)Other fiction\nFarthing Hall (1929) (Novel written in collaboration with Hugh Walpole)\nThe Town Major of Miraucourt (1930) (Short story published in a limited edition of 525 copies)\nI'll Tell You Everything (1932) (Novel written in collaboration with Gerald Bullett)\nThe Other Place (1952) (Short Stories)\nSnoggle (1971) (Novel for children)\nThe Carfitt Crisis (1975) (Two novellas and a short story)\u00a0Novelizations by Ruth Mitchell (author of the wartime novel The Lost Generation and Priestley's sister-in-law by way of his second marriage)\nDangerous Corner (1933), based on the later Broadway draft of the play, with a foreword by Priestley (paperback)\nLaburnum Grove (1936), based on the play and subsequent screenplay, published as a hardcover tie-in edition to the filmSelected plays\nThe Good Companions (1931)\nDangerous Corner (1932)\nLaburnum Grove (1933)\nEden End (1934)\nCornelius (1935)\nPeople at Sea (1936)\nBees on the Boat Deck (1936)\nTime and the Conways (1937)\nI Have Been Here Before (1937)\nWhen We Are Married (1938)\nJohnson Over Jordan (1939)\nThe Long Mirror (1940)\nThey Came to a City (1943)\nAn Inspector Calls (1945)\nEver Since Paradise (1946)\nThe Linden Tree (1947)\nSummer Day's Dream (1949)\nMother's Day (1950)\nThe White Countess (1954)\nMr. Kettle and Mrs. Moon (1955)\nThe Glass Cage (1957)\nThe Thirty-first of June: A Tale of True Love, Enterprise and Progress in the Arthurian and AD-Atomic Ages\nNovel.

He was an authority on Pushkin and an important member of the Russian Formalist school.\n\nBiography\nYury Tynyanov was born in Rezhitsa, Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire (present-day R\u0113zekne, Latvia). His brother-in-law was Veniamin Kaverin, another well-known Russian author. While attending the Petrograd University, Tynyanov frequented the Pushkin seminar held by a venerable literary academic, Semyon Vengerov. His first works made their appearance in print in 1921.\nHe died of multiple sclerosis in Moscow.\n\nMajor works\nIn 1928, together with the linguist Roman Jakobson, he published a famous work titled Theses on Language, a predecessor to structuralism (but see Ferdinand de Saussure), which could be summarised in the following manner (from ref.):\n\nLiterary science had to have a firm theoretical basis and an accurate terminology.\nThe structural laws of a specific field of literature had to be established before it was related to other fields.\nThe evolution of literature must be studied as a system. All evidence, whether literary or non-literary must be analysed functionally.\nThe distinction between synchrony and diachrony was useful for the study of literature as for language, uncovering systems at each separate stage of development. But the history of systems is also a system; each synchronic system has its own past and future as part of its structure. Therefore the distinction should not be preserved beyond its usefulness.\nA synchronic system is not a mere agglomerate of contemporaneous phenomena catalogued. 'Systems' mean hierarchical organisation.\nThe distinction between langue and parole, taken from linguistics, deserves to be developed for literature in order to reveal the principles underlying the relationship between the individual utterance and a prevailing complex of norms.\nThe analysis of the structural laws of literature should lead to the setting up of a limited number of structural types and evolutionary laws governing those types.\nThe discovery of the 'immanent laws' of a genre allows one to describe an evolutionary step, but not to explain why this step has been taken by literature and not another. Here the literary must be related to the relevant non-literary facts to find further laws, a 'system of systems'. But still the immanent laws of the individual work had to be enunciated first.Tynyanov also wrote historical novels in which he applied his theories. His other works included popular biographies of Alexander Pushkin and Wilhelm K\u00fcchelbecker and notable translations of Heinrich Heine and other authors.\n\nSelected bibliography\nIn English\nWorks by Yury Tynyanov\n\nFormalist theory, translated by L.M.

Many of his novels involve the detective hero Kogoro Akechi, who in later books was the leader of a group of boy detectives known as the \"Boy Detectives Club\" (\u5c11\u5e74\u63a2\u5075\u56e3, Sh\u014dnen tantei dan).\nRanpo was an admirer of Western mystery writers, and especially of Edgar Allan Poe.  His pen name is a rendering of Poe's name.  Other authors who were special influences on him were Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, whom he attempted to translate into Japanese during his days as a student at Waseda University, and the Japanese mystery writer Ruik\u014d Kuroiwa.\n\nBiography\nBefore World War II\nTar\u014d Hirai was born in Nabari, Mie Prefecture in 1894, where his grandfather had been a samurai in the service of Tsu Domain. The family moved to what is now Kameyama, Mie, and from there to Nagoya when he was age two. He studied economics at Waseda University starting in 1912. After graduating in 1916 with a degree in economics he worked a series of odd jobs, including newspaper editing, drawing cartoons for magazine publications, selling soba noodles as a street vendor, and working in a used bookstore.\nIn 1923 he made his literary debut by publishing the mystery story \"The Two-Sen Copper Coin\" (\u4e8c\u92ad\u9285\u8ca8, Ni-sen d\u014dka) under the pen name \"Edogawa Ranpo\" (pronounced quickly, this humorous pseudonym sounds much like the name of the American pioneer of detective fiction, Edgar Allan Poe, whom he admired). The story appeared in the magazine Shin Seinen, a popular magazine written largely for an adolescent audience. Shin Seinen had previously published stories by a variety of Western authors including Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, and G. K. Chesterton, but this was the first time the magazine published a major piece of mystery fiction by a Japanese author. Some, such as James B. Harris (Ranpo's first translator into English), have erroneously called this the first piece of modern mystery fiction by a Japanese writer, but well before Ranpo entered the literary scene in 1923, a number of other modern Japanese authors such as Ruik\u014d Kuroiwa, Kid\u014d Okamoto, Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki, Haruo Sat\u014d, and Kaita Murayama had incorporated elements of sleuthing, mystery, and crime within stories involving adventure, intrigue, the bizarre, and the grotesque. What struck critics as new about Ranpo\u2019s debut story \"The Two-Sen Copper Coin\" was that it focused on the logical process of ratiocination used to solve a mystery within a story that is closely related to Japanese culture. The story involves an extensive description of an ingenious code based on a Buddhist chant known as the \"nenbutsu\" as well as Japanese-language Braille.Over the course of the next several years, Edogawa went on to write a number of other stories that focus on crimes and the processes involved in solving them. Among these stories are a number of stories that are now considered classics of early 20th-century Japanese popular literature: \"The Case of the Murder on D. Hill\" (D\u5742\u306e\u6bba\u4eba\u4e8b\u4ef6, D-zaka no satsujin jiken, January 1925), which is about a woman who is killed in the course of a sadomasochistic extramarital affair, \"The Stalker in the Attic\" (\u5c4b\u6839\u88cf\u306e\u6563\u6b69\u8005, Yane-ura no Sanposha, August 1925), which is about a man who kills a neighbor in a Tokyo boarding house by dropping poison through a hole in the attic floor into his mouth, and \"The Human Chair\" (\u4eba\u9593\u6905\u5b50, Ningen Isu, October 1925), which is about a man who hides himself in a chair to feel the bodies on top of him. Mirrors, lenses, and other optical devices appear in many of Edogawa's other early stories, such as \"The Hell of Mirrors\".Although many of his first stories were primarily about sleuthing and the processes used in solving seemingly insolvable crimes, during the 1930s, he began to turn increasingly to stories that involved a combination of sensibilities often called \"ero guro nansensu\", from the three words \"eroticism, grotesquerie, and the nonsensical\". The presence of these sensibilities helped him sell his stories to the public, which was increasingly eager to read his work. One finds in these stories a frequent tendency to incorporate elements of what the Japanese at that time called \"abnormal sexuality\" (\u5909\u614b\u6027\u6b32, hentai seiyoku). For instance, a major portion of the plot of the novel The Demon of the Lonely Isle (\u5b64\u5cf6\u306e\u9b3c, Kot\u014d no oni), serialized from January 1929 to February 1930 in the journal Morning Sun (\u671d\u65e5, Asahi), involves a homosexual doctor and his infatuation for another main character.By the 1930s, Edogawa was writing regularly for a number of major public journals of popular literature, and he had emerged as the foremost voice of Japanese mystery fiction. The detective hero Kogor\u014d Akechi, who had first appeared in the story \"The Case of the Murder on D. Hill\" became a regular feature in his stories, a number of which pitted him against a dastardly criminal known as the Fiend with Twenty Faces (\u602a\u4eba\u4e8c\u5341\u9762\u76f8, Kaijin ni-j\u016b mens\u014d), who had an incredible ability to disguise himself and move throughout society. (A number of these novels were subsequently made into films.) The 1930 novel introduced the adolescent Kobayashi Yoshio (\u5c0f\u6797\u82b3\u96c4) as Kogoro's sidekick, and in the period after World War II, Edogawa wrote a number of novels for young readers that involved Kogoro and Kobayashi as the leaders of a group of young sleuths called the \"Boy Detectives Club\" (\u5c11\u5e74\u63a2\u5075\u56e3, Sh\u014dnen tantei dan). These works were wildly popular and are still read by many young Japanese readers, much like the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew mysteries are popular mysteries for adolescents in the English-speaking world.\n\nDuring World War II\nIn 1939, two years after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Edogawa was ordered by government censors to drop his story \"The Caterpillar\" (\u828b\u866b, Imo Mushi), which he had published without incident a few years before, from a collection of his short stories that the publisher Shun'y\u014dd\u014d was reprinting. \"The Caterpillar\" is about a veteran who was turned into a quadriplegic and so disfigured by war that he was little more than a human \"caterpillar\", unable to talk, move, or live by himself. Censors banned the story, apparently believing that the story would detract from the current war effort. This came as a blow to Ranpo, who relied on royalties from reprints for income. (The short story inspired director K\u014dji Wakamatsu, who drew from it his movie Caterpillar, which competed for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival.)\nOver the course of World War II, especially during the full-fledged war between Japan and the US that began after in 1941, Edogawa was active in his local neighborhood organization, and he wrote a number of stories about young detectives and sleuths that might be seen as in line with the war effort, but he wrote most of these under different pseudonyms as if to disassociate them with his legacy. In February 1945, his family was evacuated from their home in Ikebukuro, Tokyo to Fukushima in northern Japan. Edogawa remained until June, when he was suffering from malnutrition. Much of Ikebukuro was destroyed in Allied air raids and the subsequent fires that broke out in the city, but miraculously, the thick, earthen-walled warehouse which he used as his studio was spared, and still stands to this day beside the campus of Rikkyo University.\n\nPostwar\nIn the postwar period, Edogawa dedicated a great deal of energy to promoting mystery fiction, both in terms of the understanding of its history and encouraging the production of new mystery fiction. In 1946, he put his support behind a new journal called Jewels (\u5b9d\u77f3, H\u014dseki) dedicated to mystery fiction, and in 1947, he founded the Detective Author\u2019s Club (\u63a2\u5075\u4f5c\u5bb6\u30af\u30e9\u30d6, Tantei sakka kurabu), which changed its name in 1963 to the Mystery Writers of Japan (\u65e5\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4f5c\u5bb6\u5354\u4f1a, Nihon Suiri Sakka Ky\u014dkai). In addition, he wrote a large number of articles about the history of Japanese, European, and American mystery fiction. Many of these essays were published in book form. Other than essays, much of his postwar literary production consisted largely of novels for juvenile readers featuring Kogor\u014d Akechi and the Boy Detectives Club.\nIn the 1950s, he and a bilingual translator collaborated for five years on a translation of Edogawa's works into English, published as Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination by Tuttle. Since the translator could speak but not read Japanese, and Edogawa could read but not write English, the translation was done aurally, with Edogawa reading each sentence aloud, then checking the written English.Another of his interests, especially during the late 1940s and 1950s, was bringing attention to the work of his dear friend Jun'ichi Iwata (1900\u20131945), an anthropologist who had spent many years researching the history of homosexuality in Japan. During the 1930s, Edogawa and Iwata had engaged in a light-hearted competition to see who could find the most books about erotic desire between men. Edogawa dedicated himself to finding books published in the West and Iwata dedicated himself to finding books having to do with Japan. Iwata died in 1945, with only part of his work published, so Edogawa worked to have the remaining work on queer historiography published.In the postwar period, a large number of Edogawa's books were made into films. The interest in using Edogawa's literature as a departure point for creating films has continued well after his death. Edogawa, who suffered from a variety of health issues, including atherosclerosis and Parkinson's disease, died from a cerebral hemorrhage at his home in 1965. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Fuchu, near Tokyo.\nThe Edogawa Rampo Prize (\u6c5f\u6238\u5ddd\u4e71\u6b69\u8cde Edogawa Ranpo Sh\u014d?), named after Edogawa Rampo, is a Japanese literary award which has been presented every year by the Mystery Writers of Japan since 1955. The winner is given a prize of \u00a510 million with publication rights by Kodansha.\nWorks in English translation\nBooksEdogawa Rampo (1956), Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination, translated by James B.

Ishii's Horrors of Malformed Men from 1969 incorporates plot elements from a number of Ranpo stories. Noboru Tanaka filmed Watcher in the Attic as part of Nikkatsu's Roman porno series in 1976.\nThe manga group CLAMP used Edogawa as one of the inspirations for the series Man of Many Faces (1990\u20131991).\nAkio Jissoji's films Watcher in the Attic (1992) and Murder on D Street (1998) are both adaptations of Ranpo's works.  In both these movies Kogor\u014d Akechi is played by actor Ky\u016bsaku Shimada.\nIn 1994, a film entitled Rampo inspired by Ranpo's works was released in Japan (The film was retitled The Mystery of Rampo for its American release).  Ranpo himself is the lead character of the film and is portrayed by actor Naoto Takenaka.\nThe 1999 film Gemini by Shinya Tsukamoto is based on an Edogawa Ranpo story.\nSome of Ranpo's stories were later turned into short films in the 2005 compilation Rampo Noir, starring the well-known actor Tadanobu Asano.\nBarbet Schroeder's 2008 film Inju: The Beast in the Shadow is an adaptation of Ranpo's 1928 short story.\nThe horror manga artist Suehiro Maruo had adapted two of Ranpo's stories: The Strange Tale of the Panorama Island (2008) and \"The Caterpillar\" (2009).\nIn 2009 the Japanese Google homepage displayed a logo commemorating his birthday on October 21.\nThe manga and anime series Detective Conan (Meitantei Conan) has the main character's alias as 'Edogawa Conan', created from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Edogawa Ranpo's names. The detective that he lives with is called Mouri Kogoro, and Conan is part of a children's detective group called the Detective Boys (Shonen Tantei Dan); all apparent homages to the late Ranpo.\nThe anime and manga Bungo Stray Dogs has a character named Edogawa Ranpo, who is incredibly talented at solving crimes the police have trouble with and other mysteries.  He claims to have a skill called \"Super Deduction\", but in reality, he is one of the few members of the Armed Detective Agency not to have a special ability.\nThe last two episodes (10 and 11) of the 2013 Fuji Television (\u30d5\u30b8\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\uff09series, Biblia Koshod\u014d no Jiken Tech\u014d (\u30d3\u30d6\u30ea\u30a2\u53e4\u66f8\u5802\u306e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u624b\u5e16 Antiquarian Bookseller Biblia\u2019s Case Files), are constructed around two Edogawa Ranpo works, Boys Detective Club and The Man Traveling with the Brocade Portrait (translated as \u201cThe Traveler with the Pasted Rag Picture\u201d).\nThe online game Bungou to Alchemist featured Ranpo as one of the writers the player can get. In the game, he is portrayed as an eccentric man who hates mainstream things and enjoys creating new tricks, non-malicious pranks, and ways to defeat the enemy.\nThe 2015 anime Rampo Kitan: Game of Laplace was inspired by the works of Edogawa and commemorates the 50th anniversary of his death.See also\nJapanese literature\nJapanese detective fiction\nJapanese horror\nMystery Writers of Japan\nEdogawa Rampo Prize\nDetective ConanReferences\nSecondary sources\nAngles, Jeffrey (2011), Writing the Love of Boys: Origins of Bish\u014dnen Culture in Modernist Japanese Literature.

L. Lucas, was an English classical scholar, literary critic, poet, novelist, playwright, political polemicist, Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and intelligence officer at Bletchley Park during World War II.\nHe is now best remembered for his scathing 1923 review of T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, and for his book Style (1955; revised 1962), an acclaimed guide to recognising and writing good prose. His Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's 'Poetics' (1927, substantially revised in 1957) was for over fifty years a standard introduction. His most important contribution to scholarship was his four-volume old-spelling Complete Works of John Webster (1927), the first collected edition of the Jacobean dramatist since that of Hazlitt the Younger (1857), itself an inferior copy of Dyce (1830). Eliot called Lucas \"the perfect annotator\", and subsequent Webster scholars have been indebted to him, notably the editors of the new Cambridge Webster (1995\u20132007).Lucas is also remembered for his anti-fascist campaign in the 1930s, and for his wartime work at Bletchley Park, for which he received the OBE.\nBiographical\nEarly life and the War\nF. L. (\"Peter\") Lucas grew up in Blackheath and was educated at Colfe's, where his father F. W. Lucas (1860\u20131931) was headmaster, and from 1910 at Rugby, where he was tutored by the Sophocles scholar Robert Whitelaw (1843\u20131917) in his last year before retirement. He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1913 to read for the Classical Tripos, adding the Pitt Scholarship and the Porson Prize in 1914. In January 1914 he was elected Apostle \u2013 the last Apostle elected before the War \u2013 coming under the influence of G. E. Moore. Believing Cambridge threatened with the fate of Louvain, he volunteered, aged 19, in October 1914 and was commissioned in November, serving from 1915 as second lieutenant in the 7th Battalion The Royal West Kent Regiment in France. From August 1915 he was in the Somme trenches opposite Fricourt and Mametz; he was wounded by shrapnel in May 1916. \"One simply gapes at the gigantic capriciousness of things,\" he wrote to John Maynard Keynes in October of that year, \"waiting our own turn to disappear in the Cyclops' maw.\"  He returned to the front as lieutenant in January 1917, went into battle near Grandcourt on 17 February in the Ancre Offensive, was mentioned in despatches on 22 February, and was gassed on 4 March. In all he spent seventeen months in war-hospitals. By September 1917 he felt that the cause of honour and justice had been lost in the lust of Victory  (\"We were too ready to go on fighting without offering terms\" ). Passed fit for garrison duty at Chatham, he sought the help of fellow-Apostle Keynes to return to France, and from August 1918 to the Armistice he was Staff lieutenant in the Intelligence Corps (Third Army HQ), examining German prisoners near Bapaume and Le Quesnoy. His life hung in the balance in November 1918 shortly after the Armistice, when his lung wounds reopened in the influenza pandemic. He returned to Cambridge in January 1919. Fell-walking in the Lake District \"on Easter morning [1919] on Kidsty Pike, between Hawes Water and Hayes Water, a blinding spring sun on snowy ridge beyond ridge, from Fairfield to Blucathra, brought a moment of such ecstatic intoxication that, were I a mystic, I should have called it a mystical experience.\"\nCareer\nResuming his undergraduate studies, Lucas won a Chancellor's Medal for Classics and the Browne Medal (1920), and revived meetings of the Apostles, suspended since 1914, becoming Society Secretary and contributing nineteen papers. He was elected to a Fellowship at King's College in 1920 before he had completed his degree, Keynes paying for him to holiday in Greece with Sebastian Sprott on the eve of his Tripos. He took a starred first  and began his career as a Classics lecturer in October 1920. In the spring of 1921 he spent three months in Greece as a student of the British School at Athens, researching the site of the Battle of Pharsalus in Thessaly (see Pharsalus below). Back in Cambridge he switched that year to teaching for the English Tripos (instituted in 1919). He was a member of the Cambridge University English Faculty from 1921\u20131939 and from 1945\u20131962, and a University Reader in English from 1947\u20131962. At the invitation of Desmond MacCarthy, literary editor of the New Statesman, Lucas reviewed poetry and criticism for that journal from 1922 to 1926, having begun his career as reviewer with the Athenaeum in 1920\u201321, its last year. Early reviews and essays were collected in his Authors Dead and Living (1926). Among them was a review of Housman's Last Poems (1922) that, unusually, met with the approval of the poet himself. His move from Classics to English and his edition of Webster (1927) were inspired in large part by J. T. Sheppard's March 1920 Marlowe Society production of The White Devil, which made a powerful impression on him: \"What could make the Cambridge production of The White Devil in 1920 seem, to at least two who saw it then without preconceptions, the most staggering performance they had ever known?\" he asked in the New Statesman. (The production had been swift-moving, in the Elizabethan manner, with minimal scenery and with emphasis on \"beautiful poetry beautifully spoken\".) \"[Lucas] has been lucky in finding a writer [Webster] who takes his standpoint,\" T. E. Lawrence remarked, \"and sums up life rather in his fashion.\" Lucas' preference, however, lay with Comparative Literature, and after Webster he turned to his Studies French and English (1934; revised 1950) (he was Membre Correspondant Honoraire de L'Institut Litt\u00e9raire et Artistique de France ), and later to studies of Scandinavian literature. He served as committee member for the Cambridge Greek Play (1921\u201333) and continued to write on Greek and Latin literature. As part-time Librarian at King's (1922\u201336) he accessioned the donated papers of Rupert Brooke. His students at King's included George Rylands, John Hayward, F. E. Halliday, H. C. A. \"Tom\" Gaunt, Alan Clutton-Brock, Julian Bell, Winton Dean and Desmond Flower. By Cambridge English students in general he was known as \"F. L.\".\nFollowing the publication of his Webster, scholars turned to him for editorial advice: he helped in the preparation of Hayward's Nonesuch Donne (1929), Housman's More Poems (1936), Theodore Redpath's Songs and Sonets of John Donne (1956), and Ingram and Redpath's Shakespeare's Sonnets (1964). He also performed an editorial and advisory role for Christopher Sandford at the Golden Cockerel Press, where he introduced Victor Scholderer's New Hellenic typeface (1937). A number of his verse translations from Greek and Latin, with engravings by John Buckland Wright, were published in collectors' editions by the Golden Cockerel Press and Folio Society. In the middle years of his career he was in demand as an invitation lecturer, giving seven BBC wireless talks in 1930, on Dorothy Osborne and on the Victorian Poets, delivering the 1933 Warton Lecture on English Poetry to the British Academy, lecturing at the Royal Institution on Classicism and Romanticism (1935) and at the Royal Society of Literature on travel writing (1937), and, as part of a British Council drive to counter Soviet propaganda, lecturing in German on European literature to packed halls at the British Information Centre in West Berlin in October 1948 during the Berlin Blockade.In later years Lucas won acclaim for his translations from the classics (see Verse translation below) and for his book Style (1955). He also turned encyclopedist, contributing articles on 'Poetry', 'Epic', 'Lyric', 'Ode', 'Elegy' and 'Pastoral' to the 15-volume 1950 Chambers's Encyclopaedia, among others, and serving on the editorial board of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Great Books of the Western World series (1952). As he told Nikos Kazantzakis, who visited him in Cambridge after the War, Je ne lis plus; je relis [:I no longer read; I reread].For Lucas's anti-fascist campaign in the Thirties and his wartime service in Intelligence, see Appeasement and Bletchley Park below.\n\nPersonal life\nFrom February 1921 to 1929 Lucas was married to the novelist E. B. C. Jones (1893\u20131966), known as \"Topsy\" to her friends. She was the sister-in-law of his former supervisor at Trinity, Donald Robertson; he got to know her after reading and admiring her first novel, Quiet Interior (1920). Jones dedicated two novels to Lucas and based two characters on him \u2013 Hugh Sexton, gassed in the War, in The Singing Captives (1922), and Oliver in The Wedgwood Medallion (1923), a Cambridge classics graduate now studying the Elizabethan drama. Lucas based the character Margaret Osborne in The River Flows (1926) on her \u2013 a semi-autobiographical first novel that shifts some of his experiences of 1919\u20131920 to 1913\u20131915. The character Hugh Fawcett (\"the best brain in the Foreign Office\" but not much use as a matchmaker) was based on Keynes. Through the Apostles Lucas was associated with the Bloomsbury Group, Virginia Woolf describing him to Ottoline Morrell as \"pure Cambridge: clean as a breadknife, and as sharp\". To Lucas, interviewed in 1958, Bloomsbury had seemed \"a jungle\":\n\n\"The society of Virginia and Leonard Woolf, Duncan Grant, Clive and Vanessa Bell, and Lytton Strachey was far from being in the ordinary sense a happy family. They were intensely and rudely critical of each other. They were the sort of people who would read letters addressed to others. They tormented each other with endless love affairs. In real crises they could be generous, but in ordinary affairs of life they were anything but kind ... Dickinson and Forster were not really Bloomsbury. They were soft-hearted and kind. Bloomsbury was certainly not that.\"Jones's admiration for George Rylands undermined the marriage by 1927. After affairs with Dora Carrington (d.1932) and Shelagh Clutton-Brock (d.1936), in December 1932 Lucas married the 21-year-old Girton Classics graduate and sculptor Prudence Wilkinson (1911\u20131944). His travel writings, accounts of their long walks through landscapes with literary associations, date from the years of his second marriage (1932\u20131939): From Olympus to the Styx (1934), a book on their 1933 walking tour of Greece (one of five journeys he made to that country), 'Iceland', a travelogue on their 1934 journey to the saga sites, included in the original edition of his The Decline and Fall of the Romantic Ideal (1936); and journal-entries on their visits to Norway, Ireland, Scotland, and France. In these years they were frequent visitors to the home in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence of Marie Mauron, whose Proven\u00e7al stories Lucas translated. From Olympus to the Styx argues for the return of the Elgin Marbles:\n\n\"Considering what was to come, the much-abused 'theft' of the sculptures from the Acropolis by Lord Elgin was an undoubted blessing, though it was carelessly carried out, especially in removing the Caryatid from the Erechtheum; it would none the less be a graceful act for England to return them now to Athens.\"Prudence Lucas, as well as sharing these interests, designed the costumes and sets for the first production (1938) of his Icelandic tragedy The Lovers of Gudrun. Her nervous breakdown in 1938 is touched on in Lucas's Journal Under the Terror, 1938 (1939); Lucas sought help from, among others, Wilhelm Stekel, whom he met in London in 1939, but the rift proved irreparable. The emphasis on psychology in his post-war books \u2013 Literature and Psychology (1951), Style (1955), The Search for Good Sense (1958), The Art of Living (1959), the essay on 'Happiness' in The Greatest Problem (1960), The Drama of Ibsen and Strindberg (1962) \u2013 reflects an interest shared with his third wife (1940\u20131967), the Swedish psychologist Elna Kallenberg (1906-2003), whom he married in 1940 \u2013 \"the stranger who came to me from beyond the sea when I most needed her\" (Elna Kallenberg had flown from Sweden, with special permission from the Home Office, to join him in late 1939). They had two children, Signe and Sigurd.\n\nLucas returned time and again in his books to the theme of happiness, and in 1960 summed up his thoughts on happiness thus:\n\n\"Vitality of mind and body; the activity to employ and maintain them; the zest and curiosity that they can animate; freedom to travel widely in nature and art, in countries of the world and countries of the mind; human affections; and the gift of gaiety \u2013 these seem to me, then, the main causes of happiness. I am surprised to find how few and simple they are.\"F. L. Lucas lived at 7 Camden Place, Cambridge, from 1921\u201325; at 20 West Road, Cambridge from 1925\u201339; at High Mead, Great Brickhill from 1939\u201345; and again at 20 West Road, Cambridge, from 1945 until his death in 1967. The dissident Czech academic Otakar Vo\u010dadlo (1895\u20131974), Lucas's Prague correspondent in 1938-39 (see Appeasement below) and a concentration camp survivor, celebrated his restoration, during the Prague Spring of 1968, to his Chair of English at Prague, by giving a course of lectures on Webster in memory of Lucas, whose support for the Czech cause in 1938\u201339 had not been forgotten.D. W. Lucas, the classical scholar (1905\u201385), Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, University Director of Studies in Classics, and Perceval Maitland Laurence Reader in Classics, was F. L. Lucas's brother.\n\nLiterary criticism\nApproach\nExcept in reviews of work by contemporaries, Lucas adopted the historical and biographical approach to criticism and examined the views of earlier critics, whose dogmatism he was swift to rebut. He increasingly linked his studies to developments in psychology, notably in Literature and Psychology (1951). \"The real 'unwritten laws',\" he observed, \"seem to me those of human psychology.\" Centrally, he discussed the writer's psychology as revealed through style. \"Even science,\" he noted, \"has invented no pickle for embalming a man like style.\"The poets to whom he returned most often in publications were Tennyson (1930, 1932, 1947, 1957) and Housman (1926, 1933, 1936, 1960), but he ranged widely over Classical, European and English literature. Conscious that books can influence for good or ill, he admired authors he saw as defenders of sanity and good sense \u2013 men like Montaigne and Montesquieu \u2013 or as compassionate realists, like Homer in the Iliad, Euripides, Hardy, Ibsen and Chekhov. \"Life is 'indivisible',\" he wrote.\n\n\"A public tends to get the literature it deserves: a literature, to get the public it deserves. The values men pursue in each, affect the other. They turn in a vicious, or a virtuous, circle. Only a fine society could have bred Homer: and he left it finer for hearing him.\"His criticism, while acknowledging that morality is historically relative, was thus values-based. \"Writers can make men feel, not merely see, the values that endure.\" Believing that too many modern writers encouraged men and women to flee to unreason, decadence and barbarism, he condemned the trahisons des clercs of the twentieth century, and used his lectures and writing to campaign for a responsible use of intellectual freedom. \"One may question whether real civilisation is so safely afloat,\" he wrote in his last published letter (1966), \"that we can afford to use our pens for boring holes in the bottom of it.\" The writer or artist serving up \"slapdash nightmares out of his Unconscious\", \"in an age morbidly avid of uncivilised irreticence\", not only exhibited his own neuroses, but fed neurosis in others. Literary critics, too, had to take more responsibility. \"Much cant gets talked,\" he noted of the Structuralists, \"by critics who care more for the form and organisation of a work than for its spirit, its content, its supreme moments.\" The serious note in his criticism was counterbalanced by wit and urbanity, by lively anecdote and quotation, and by a gift for startling imagery and epigram.\nWhat Lucas wrote about Housman's Name and Nature of Poetry in 1933 (though he contested some of its ideas) sums up what he himself aspired to as a literary critic: \"\u2026 the kind of critical writing that best justifies itself before the brevity of life; that itself adds new data to our experience as well as arguing about the old; that happily combines, in a word, philosophy with autobiography, psychology with a touch of poetry \u2013 of the \u2018poetic\u2019 imagination. It can make acceptable even common sense. There are sentences here which recall the clear-cut Doric strength of the Lives of the Poets ...\"His Cambridge colleague T. R. Henn noted that Lucas's approach and style were influenced by the Strachey of Books and Characters (1922).\nControversy\nLucas's impatience with the \"obscurantism\" and coterie-appeal of much modern poetry made him in the interwar years one of the foremost opponents of the new schools. \"As for 'profundity',\" he wrote, \"it is not uncommonly found also in dry wells; which may likewise contain little but obscurity and rubbish.\" He opposed also what he saw as the narrow dogmatism of the New Critics, those \"tight-lipped Calvins of art\", as he called them, of Criterion and Scrutiny. Discussions of I. A. Richards's criticism appear in his essay 'English Literature' in the volume University Studies: Cambridge 1933  and in Chapter 4 of his Decline and Fall of the Romantic Ideal (1936), and of Eliot's in the 1929 essay 'Modern Criticism', reprinted in his Studies French and English (1934). An anonymous New Statesman review (29 December 1928) of Eliot's criticism, however, to which F. R. Leavis replied apparently believing it was by Lucas, and which Leavis's biographer says \"was certainly by Lucas\", was in fact by Richard Ellis Roberts. Lucas had stopped reviewing for the New Statesman in 1926 and never reviewed anonymously. His critique of Q. D. Leavis's Fiction and the Reading Public (1932) in University Studies: Cambridge 1933 was described by F. R. Leavis's biographer as \"improper\": \"senior academics do not use quasi-official publications to attack graduate students\". (The volume, though printed by the University Press, was not published there; its editor stressed that the contributions were \"unofficial\" glimpses into the \"intense mental activity\" of each Cambridge department; and published theses are not normally considered exempt from criticism.)\n\nLucas and Eliot\nLucas's 1923 review of The Waste Land, much reprinted in the decades since his death, was omitted from his Authors Dead and Living (1926), a collection of New Statesman pieces, probably because he had ended by saying the poem should be left to sink. Remarks elsewhere confirm that he had not changed his opinion. Described by F. W. Bateson as \"brilliantly wrong-headed\", the review is better known today than it was during Lucas's lifetime. His only other comment on the poem occurs in his essay 'English Literature' in the volume University Studies: Cambridge 1933, where he contested I. A. Richards' view of it in Science and Poetry (1926): \"The Waste Land is praised [by Richards] for its 'complete severence' from 'all beliefs', when it is really a yearning cry for them, and at its close some sort of faith is so clearly impending that it has been praised by others as a great religious poem (such are the triumphs of obscurity).\" The Letters of T. S. Eliot  includes correspondence between Eliot and Lucas from the mid-1920s but no reference to the review. Historians of The New Statesman have regretted that Desmond MacCarthy invited Lucas to review modern poetry, one of them declaring Lucas \"a disastrous choice\" for a Waste Land review. (Disastrous, that is, for the journal's avant-garde image.) After 1923, though attacking obscurantism in general terms, Lucas largely ignored Eliot's poetry, aside from a retrospective dig in 1942 at 'The Hollow Men' (\"hollow men whimpering under prickly pear trees, conceited still amid their grovellings because a prickly pear remains an exotic and highly intellectual plant\" ) and at 'Sweeney among the Nightingales' (\"the nightingales of Aeschylus now exhibit to a ravished public their 'droppings'; for to the sewer all things are sewer\" ). On the later Eliot he was silent. He had no time for mystical poetry, regarding religion as an aberration of the human mind.In 1928 Lucas had been stung by Eliot's review in the Times Literary Supplement criticising aspects of the Introduction to his Webster. He replied vigorously in the same journal, only to find Eliot extending his criticisms in another review in The Criterion. Lucas counter-attacked in his 1929 essay 'Modern Criticism', ridiculing Eliot's literary-critical obiter dicta and hieratic tone. In later impressions of his essays, Eliot made minor changes or added clarifications to sentences Lucas had ridiculed, and praised the textual and historical scholarship of the 1927 Webster. Lucas left the Introduction out of his 1958 revised editions of the two major plays, but demand for the unabridged 1927 Webster continued, and it was reprinted on both sides of the Atlantic in 1966.\n\nReputation\nLucas's standing as a literary critic was probably at its highest in the 1930s. \"In three respects,\" wrote the Times Literary Supplement in 1934, \"Lucas rises pre-eminent from the crowd of contemporary critics: in his care for style, for dignity and grace in his method of presentment: in his learning in the literature of several languages: and in the balance, the sanity of his judgment.\" Post-war, reviewers were often more hostile. Many post-war reviews amounted to reprisals by the Leavisite camp: \"There is an air of breezy Bloomsbury superficiality and cultural omniscience about this book that is distressing,\" wrote one. \"His is the type of over-cultivated fuddy-duddy mind that has done \u2013 and is doing \u2013 great damage to our whole culture in general and to literary appreciation in particular.\" Probably because, psychoanalytic literary criticism aside, Lucas scorned most new trends \u2013 he described the critical theory of the 1950s as \"largely pseudo-scientific bubble-blowing\" \u2013 his criticism has long been out of fashion and is mostly out of print. \n\n\"The literary world has passed on,\" wrote L. P. Wilkinson, \"but that does not mean that what supervened was better; and just because of his uncompromising brilliance the whirligig of time may bring in his criticism again. His Style (1955) has a permanent value in any case, unaffected by trends.\" Style is now back in print (2012). His two earliest books, Seneca and Elizabethan Tragedy (1922) (his Fellowship dissertation) and Euripides and His Influence (1923), not yet superseded in similar concise form, continue to be reprinted. The editors of the new Cambridge Webster (1995\u20132007) praise \"his customary accuracy and astuteness\" in matters of dating, authorship, and textual scholarship. \"With its voluminous and marvellously wide-ranging notes,\" writes D. C. Gunby, \"Lucas's four-volume, old-spelling edition remains essential reading for those who love scholarship and, more, love the plays of John Webster\".\nVerse translation\nLucas dedicated much of his time to making classical (mainly Greek) poetry accessible to modern readers through verse translations. His companion volumes Greek Poetry for Everyman (1951) and Greek Drama for Everyman (1954) contain some 20,000 lines. No single translator had attempted before to bring together in homogeneous volumes so much of the best of Greek poetry from Homer to the 6th century A.D., with the introductions and notes needed by the non-classicist. The translations were praised for their grace and fidelity \u2013 \"the sense and the imagery are minutely reproduced\" (The Classical Review ) \u2013 and were hailed by the press as Cambridge's single-handed answer to the [collaborative] Oxford Book of Greek Verse in Translation. Lucas's versions, however, presuppose a taste for a poetic style closer to Morris than to Pound. Reviewers generally preferred his translations of lyric, Alexandrian and later poetry to the 7,000 rhymed lines from Homer, which were omitted from the second edition (Everyman Library, 1966). Of the second volume, Greek Drama, a reviewer wrote: \"Lucas makes the plays deceptively easy to read and appreciate by smoothing away the austerities and complexities of the Greek \u2013 qualities which some modernists conscientiously preserve or even exaggerate.\" The translation of Hippolytus remains in print in the Penguin selection, Eight Great Tragedies, ed. Sylvan Barnet.\nOriginal writing\nNovels\nOf Lucas's novels the best received was C\u00e9cile (1930), a tale of love, society and politics in the France of 1775\u20131776. Lucas dedicated the book to T. E. Lawrence, a friend and admirer. He wrote two further historical novels, Doctor Dido (1938), set in Cambridge in 1792\u20131812, and The English Agent: A Tale of the Peninsular War (1969), set in Spain in 1808; and a novella, The Woman Clothed with the Sun (1937), on the Buchanites of the 1780s\u201390s. The three novels focus on a love-affair between an Englishman and a Frenchwoman (Lucas was a self-confessed gallomane); the Scots novella takes the form of an account, written by a Scottish minister in middle age, of his youthful bewitchment by Elspeth Buchan and of his curious sojourn among the Buchanites. A theme common to all four is the tension between fragile 18th-century rationalism and, in varying forms, Romantic \"enthusiasm\" and unreason. For his semi-autobiographical first novel, The River Flows (1926), see Personal Life above.\n\nPoems\nAs a poet Lucas was a polished ironist. Early collections (Time and Memory, 1929, Marionettes, 1930, Poems, 1935) were mostly personal lyrics or satires, but he came to specialise in dramatic monologues and narrative poems based on historical episodes \"that seem lastingly alive\" (Messene Redeemed, 1940; From Many Times and Lands, 1953). His First World War poems, including 'Morituri \u2013 August 1915, on the road from Morlancourt' (1935) and (below) ' \"The Night is Chilly but not Dark\" ' (1935), offer a retrospect of his experiences at the front.\n\nOn nights when the moon creeps shrouded up the sky\nAnd hedge and holt lie glimmering ghostly grey,\nA voice still whispers in me, far away \u2013\nA good night, this, for wiring \u2013 and suddenly\nThere rises from the dead that shadowy hell,\nThe barbed-wire rasps, uncoiling through my hand,\nThe flares dance flickering over no-man's-land,\nA dull machine-gun raps from La Boisselle.\nThen fades the phantom, and once more I know\nOur spider-webs of wire are rust by now,\nOur battlefields reconquered by the plough,\nAnd hands that worked with mine, dust long ago.The inclusion of 'Beleaguered Cities' (1929) in various mid-twentieth century anthologies of English verse made it probably Lucas's best-known poem. Others that have gained currency through anthologies include 'The Destined Hour' (1953), a re-telling in verse of the old 'appointment in Samarra' fable, and 'Spain 1809', the story of a village woman's courage during the French occupation in the Peninsular War. His most ambitious poem was Ariadne (1932), an epic re-working of the Labyrinth myth, extracts from which were read on the BBC Home Service in 1934.\nPlays\nLucas's most successful play was the thriller Land's End (1935), set in Cornwall in the mid-1930s (Westminster Theatre, February\u2013March 1938, 29 performances, with Cathleen Nesbitt, Cecil Trouncer and Alan Napier among the cast). One of Paul Scofield's earliest roles was in the Birmingham Rep's revival of the play in March\u2013April 1945. Lucas's radio play The Siren was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme in 1948, with Catherine Lacey, Frith Banbury and Deryck Guyler in the cast; a second production followed on the Home Service in 1949, with Cathleen Nesbitt and Hugh Burden. The play dramatises George Sand's amorous escapades in Paris and Italy with Alfred de Musset and Dr. Pietro Pagello \u2013 the subject of the 1999 film Les Enfants du Si\u00e8cle. His political drama The Bear Dances: A Play in Three Acts was the first dramatisation of the Soviets on London\u2019s West-end stage (Garrick Theatre, 1932, with Elena Miramova, Abraham Sofaer and Olga Lindo). This play, though it closed early in London, was revived by various repertory theatres in the North of England in the later 1930s. It was an attempt at ideological disinfectant, written at a time when Cambridge University (in Lucas's words) \"grew full of very green young men going very Red\".\nHistory, politics and society\nPharsalus\nOutside literature, Lucas is remembered for his solution to one of the more contentious problems of ancient topography. His \"north-bank\" thesis on the location of the Battle of Pharsalus (48 B.C.), based on his 1921 solo field-trip to Thessaly and on a re-examination of the sources, dismissed a dozen previous theories and is now widely accepted by historians.  John D. Morgan in his definitive 'Palae-pharsalus \u2013 the Battle and the Town' writes:  \"My reconstruction is similar to Lucas\u2019s, and in fact I borrow one of his alternatives for the line of the Pompeian retreat. Lucas\u2019s theory has been subjected to many criticisms, but has remained essentially unshaken.\"\n\nAppeasement\nAre our minds clear, or are we drifting foggily into another 1914? It was because England hedged then, that we all but perished in the ditch beyond.\nIn the 1930s Lucas was widely known for his political letters to the British Press with their outspoken attacks on the policy that came to be known as appeasement. Following the inaction of the League over Manchuria, he called repeatedly for \"a League within the League\", of nations pledged to uphold international law and oppose aggression. \"Since the War,\" he wrote in 1933, \"British policy has been shuffling, timid, ignoble.\" Having read Mein Kampf in the unexpurgated original and taken its threats as a statement of intent, he urged in September 1933 that Nazi Germany be prevented from re-arming. \"Versailles was monstrous\", he wrote in The Week-end Review,\n\n\"but one thing surely comes first: Germany must not be allowed to re-arm. How prevent it? By an international police-force?  It would be ideal. Unfortunately it does not exist. The French have urged it. We in our muddle-headedness want neither it nor the alternative \u2013 war. Are we prepared to see France do its work instead and take action in Germany? \u2013 or are we going to sit sanctimoniously on the fence, disapproving, but secretly relieved? I devoutly hope the first. Germany must not re-arm; even if the French had to invade it once every five years, that would be better than the alternative.\"This letter struck some readers as \"brutal\", and marked him as a hard-liner. The pro-appeasement Times refused to publish him after 1935 (he described the Editor's office as \"an annexe of the German embassy\"); and when he condemned the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the democracies' inadequate response, he received abusive and threatening replies from Fascists, including one from Ezra Pound (he put Pound's letter on display at the Cambridge Anti-Fascist Exhibition). In the years following he varied his arguments, but not their message. A hatred of war, he urged in 1936, \"can be no reason for being false to ourselves, in the name of an aimless amiability that cries \u2018peace\u2019 where there is none.\" By 1937 the emphasis was on the dishonesty of British policy: \"We have not kept agreements we made; we have made agreements we should not; we have tried to cheat our way to security, and now the security proves a cheat. We have forgotten the wisdom which says that since we cannot foresee where any road will lead in the end, we should stick to the straight and honest one.\" Despite the prevailing pacifism of the time \u2013 and he exchanged views with \"passive pacifists\" in the correspondence-columns \u2013 such sentiments struck a chord. \"This is the voice of the England I love,\" wrote a correspondent from Prague in 1938, \"and for whose soul I was trembling when I heard about the welcome given Mr Chamberlain on his return from Munich.\"\nAs well as letters to the press (some forty in all, most to The Manchester Guardian \u2013 see Political letters below) his campaign included satires, articles, books, public speaking, fund-raising for the Red Cross, petitions to Parliament, meetings with \u00e9migr\u00e9s like Haile Selassie and Stefan Zweig, and help for refugees. In these activities he was inspired by the example of \"that grand old man\" H. W. Nevinson, \"one of the most striking personalities I have ever known\", \"whose long life has been given to Liberty\". He dedicated his 1938 book The Delights of Dictatorship to Nevinson, by then a friend.\nBelieving that future readers would be interested in what it had been like to live through such times, Lucas kept and published in March 1939 a\ndiary for 1938, Journal Under the Terror, 1938. (The \"high source\" he refers to in Journal was probably Harold Nicolson.) Journal is notable for its candid remarks on pro-Nazi and pro-appeasement figures in the British Establishment. Of Chamberlain at Munich he wrote (30 September):\n\n\"Even if what he did were the right thing to do, this was not the way to do it.\" \"The surrender might have been necessary: the cant was not. Any statesman with a sense of honour would at least have stilled that hysterical cheering and said: My friends, for the present, we are out of danger. But remember that others, who trusted in us, are not. This is a day for relief, perhaps; but for sorrow also; for shame, not for revelling. But this Chamberlain comes home beaming as fatuously as some country-cousin whom a couple of card-sharpers in the train have just allowed to win sixpence, to encourage him.\"The outcome he feared was an Anglo-German peace agreement \u2013 an accord between Nazis and the British Establishment: \"One day a little note from Berchtesgaden will appoint Lord Londonderry to 10 Downing Street. And that will settle everything.\" Though he welcomed the Government's about-turn on appeasement in March 1939, he doubted the genuineness of the conversion. \"The noble lords of our Fifth Column still go marching on.\"The Nazis had noted Lucas's letters. In August 1939 he received a reply from Goebbels, advising him to heed public opinion. As a leading anti-fascist campaigner, he was placed by the Nazis on their Sonderfahndungsliste G.B. [:Special Search List G.B.] of Britons to be arrested and liquidated.\n\nBletchley Park\nA brilliant linguist with infantry and Intelligence Corps experience from 1914\u201318, proven anti-fascist credentials and a scepticism about the Soviet Union, Lucas was one of the first academics recruited by the Foreign Office \u2013 on 3 September 1939 \u2013 to Bletchley Park. He was one of the original four members of Hut 3, whose organisation he set up, and from March to July 1942, when the Hut was run by committee, acting head. He remained a central figure there, working throughout the war on the Enigma decodes as translator, intelligence-analyst and (from July 1942) head of the Research Section, 3G [:Hut 3 General Intelligence], on the busy 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. shift. His main activities in 3G were cracking Axis covernames and covernumbers in decodes, analysing German \"proformas\" (supplies and ammunition returns), and writing general intelligence papers.Among the intelligence-reports he produced was a study of Hitler's intentions in the east in May 1941, which contrasted with the Foreign Office view that the Germans were just \"building up pressure [on the U.S.S.R.] to extract more raw materials\". \"It becomes harder than ever to doubt,\" Lucas wrote,\n\n\"that the object of these large movements of the German Army and Air Force is Russia. From rail movements towards Moldavia in the south to ship movements towards Varanger fjord in the far north there is everywhere the same eastward trend. Either the purpose is blackmail or it is war. No doubt Hitler would prefer a bloodless surrender. But the quiet move, for instance, of a prisoner-of-war cage to Tarnow looks more like business than bluff.\"Other Lucas papers ranged from practical suggestions, such as the proposal that the Salonica-Athens railway be cut in the Oeta gorges viaducts (carried out in Operation Harling), to psychological overviews later in the war, like 'Hitler as seen by Source' [:through decodes] and 'German Morale as seen by Source' (his old special subject from 1918 Intelligence Corps days).\nHe also wrote confidential Special Reports for the Bletchley Park Director-General, one on Second Front rumours in German signals, and another, with Peter Calvocoressi, in late 1944 on Ultra and the failure of Allied intelligence to foresee the German counter-offensive through the Ardennes in December 1944. Lucas and Calvocoressi concluded \"the costly reverse might have been avoided if Ultra had been more carefully considered\". For its part, Hut 3 had grown \"shy of going beyond its job of amending and explaining German messages\", believing that \"drawing broad conclusions was for the intelligence staff at SHAEF, who had information from all sources\", including aerial reconnaissance. E. J. N. Rose, head Air Adviser in Hut 3, read the paper at the time and described it in 1998 as \"an extremely good report\" that \"showed the failure of intelligence at SHAEF and at the Air Ministry\". The report is not known to have survived. It was probably the \"Top Secret [intelligence] digest\", a post-mortem on that failure, referred to by General Strong (1968), \"both record-copies of which were destroyed\". Lucas and Calvocoressi \"expected heads to roll at Eisenhower's HQ, but they did no more than wobble\".The most \"exciting\" work he did at Bletchley Park, he recalled, was handling operational signals on Axis convoys to North Africa from July 1941 and deducing convoys' routes using decrypts, maps, pins and pieces of string. The high standards of accuracy and clarity that prevailed in Hut 3, his chief maintained, were \"largely due to [Lucas's] being such a stickler\" for them.In out-of-hut hours Major Lucas was Officer Commanding the Bletchley Park Home Guard, a \"rabble of egg-heads\" that he turned, contrary to stereotype, into an efficient unit that outwitted the local regular forces in military exercises. From June 1945 to the end of the War he was head of the Hut 3 History Section, compiling a 'History of Hut 3', now documents HW3\/119 and HW3\/120 in the National Archives. He was awarded the OBE in 1946 for his wartime work.\nDemographics\nIn later years Lucas took up the cause of population-control, \"a problem not talked about nearly enough\", discussing the dangers of world overpopulation in The Greatest Problem (1960). Having laid out the statistics to 1959 and future projections, he argued that the \"reckless proliferation\" of homo sapiens, as well as impoverishing the world by environmental damage and species-extinctions, would be damaging to the individual and to society:\n\n\"The finest human qualities are endangered, because the size of populations increases, and ought to be diminished; the size of states increases, and ought to be diminished; the size of cities increases, and ought to be diminished. Vast communities lead to small individuals; and the real worth of any community lies in the worth of its individuals... The individual comes to feel himself a mere drop in the ocean; and feeling impotent, he grows irresponsible... Vast democracies cannot keep the virtues of democracy.\"If population-growth went unchecked, he felt, \"the damage to national efficiency might drive governments to act more intelligently\"; but better would be \"a concentrated drive for population-planning, despite the formidable practical, scientific and psychological obstacles\". \"Far more, however,\" he added, \"depends on the individual and his power to realise his own plight. Hence the need for constant and frank discussion, instead of leaving the subject, as now, in a conspiracy of uneasy silence; and the need for patient and tireless propaganda against man's reckless propagation.\"\nHe singled out the Vatican for particular criticism. \"Common sense percolates,\" he had written in 1934, \"despite the Roman Church; which with its half-cynical sense of reality will doubtless end by swallowing the inevitable, as with Copernicus and Darwin, and evolve some doctrine of Immaculate Contraception.\" He later pointed out the illogicality of the doctrine declaring it lawful to juggle with the calendar but otherwise unlawful to practise contraception.He was not optimistic about post-war immigration to the UK, believing that in the modern world the problem of over-breeding was not solved by migration, which in turn could bring new social problems. \"Persons of liberal principles are shocked if one views this influx with misgiving. But the advantages are far from certain. Principles, however liberal, are no substitute for common sense.\"In Literature and Psychology (1951) he had conjectured that the end of civilisation might come, not from war or famine, but from a decay of man's intelligence and self-control under the strain of a too artificial way of life. His only science-fiction story, 'Last Act' (1937), set in a not-too-distant future, had depicted the beginning of the end for \"the desolator, Man\", in an overpopulated, over-technological, and rapidly overheating biosphere.\nWorks\nBooks\nSeneca and Elizabethan Tragedy (Cambridge University Press, 1922 [28]\u00a0; C.U.P. paperback 2009, ISBN\u00a01-108-00358-3)\nEuripides and his Influence (Marshall Jones, Boston, 1923 [29]\u00a0; Harrap, London, 1924; Literary Licensing LLC paperback 2012, ISBN\u00a01-258-33712-6)\nEuripides: Medea, partly in the original and partly in translation; with introduction and notes (Oxford University Press, 1923)\nEuripides: Medea; verse translation, with introduction and notes (Oxford University Press, 1924)\nFerenc B\u00e9k\u00e1ssy:  'Adriatica' and other poems; selection with preface (Hogarth Press, London, 1925)\nAuthors Dead and Living; reviews and essays from the New Statesman [Li-Po, Drayton, Donne, Vaughan, Cotton, Marvell, Leopardi, Melville, Whitman, Swinburne, O'Shaughnessy, Flecker, Masefield, Housman, de la Mare, Bottomley, Davies, Rosenberg, Drinkwater, Dobson, Luce, Campbell, H.D., Edna St Vincent Millay, Belloc, Blunt, Sara Teasdale, Yeats, Lawrence, Wolfe, Sylvia Townsend Warner, Graves] (Chatto & Windus, London, 1926 [30]\u00a0; essay on Housman reprinted in the Critical Heritage series, ed.

His father was Alfred Perceval Graves, a celebrated Irish poet and figure in the Gaelic revival; they were both Celticists and students of Irish mythology. Graves produced more than 140 works in his lifetime. His poems, his translations and innovative analysis of the Greek myths, his memoir of his early life\u2014including his role in World War I\u2014Good-Bye to All That, and his speculative study of poetic inspiration, The White Goddess, have never been out of print.He earned his living from writing, particularly popular historical novels such as I, Claudius; King Jesus; The Golden Fleece; and Count Belisarius. He also was a prominent translator of Classical Latin and Ancient Greek texts; his versions of The Twelve Caesars and The Golden Ass remain popular for their clarity and entertaining style. Graves was awarded the 1934 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for both I, Claudius and Claudius the God.\nEarly life\nGraves was born into a middle-class family in Wimbledon, then part of Surrey, now part of south London. He was the third of five children born to Alfred Perceval Graves (1846\u20131931), who was the sixth child and second son of Charles Graves, Bishop of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe. His father was an Irish school inspector, Gaelic scholar and the author of the popular song \"Father O'Flynn\", and his mother was his father's second wife, Amalie Elisabeth Sophie von Ranke (1857\u20131951), the niece of the historian Leopold von Ranke.\nAt the age of seven, double pneumonia following measles almost took Graves's life, the first of three occasions when he was despaired of by his doctors as a result of afflictions of the lungs, the second being the result of a war wound (see below) and the third when he contracted Spanish influenza in late 1918, immediately before demobilisation. At school, Graves was enrolled as Robert von Ranke Graves, and in Germany his books are published under that name, but before and during the First World War the name caused him difficulties.\nIn August 1916 an officer who disliked him spread the rumour that he was the brother of a captured German spy who had assumed the name \"Karl Graves\". The problem resurfaced in a minor way in the Second World War, when a suspicious rural policeman blocked his appointment to the Special Constabulary. Graves's eldest half-brother, Philip Perceval Graves, achieved note as a journalist and his younger brother, Charles Patrick Graves, was a writer and journalist.\nEducation\nGraves received his early education at a series of six preparatory schools, including King's College School in Wimbledon, Penrallt in Wales, Hillbrow School in Rugby, Rokeby School in Kingston upon Thames and Copthorne in Sussex, from which last in 1909 he won a scholarship to Charterhouse. There he began to write poetry, and took up boxing, in due course becoming school champion at both welter- and middleweight. He claimed that this was in response to persecution because of the German element in his name, his outspokenness, his scholarly and moral seriousness, and his poverty relative to the other boys. He also sang in the choir, meeting there an aristocratic boy three years younger, G. H. \"Peter\" Johnstone, with whom he began an intense romantic friendship, the scandal of which led ultimately to an interview with the headmaster. However, Graves himself called it \"chaste and sentimental\" and \"proto-homosexual,\" and though he was clearly in love with \"Peter\" (disguised by the name \"Dick\" in Good-Bye to All That), he denied that their relationship was ever sexual. He was warned about Peter's morals by other contemporaries. Among the masters his chief influence was George Mallory, who introduced him to contemporary literature and took him mountaineering in the holidays. In his final year at Charterhouse, he won a classical exhibition to St John's College, Oxford but did not take his place there until after the war.\nFirst World War\nAt the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Graves enlisted almost immediately, taking a commission in the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers as a second lieutenant (on probation) on 12 August. He was confirmed in his rank on 10 March 1915, and received rapid promotion, being promoted to lieutenant on 5 May 1915 and to captain on 26\u00a0October. He published his first volume of poems, Over the Brazier, in 1916. He developed an early reputation as a war poet and was one of the first to write realistic poems about the experience of frontline conflict. In later years, he omitted his war poems from his collections, on the grounds that they were too obviously \"part of the war poetry boom.\" At the Battle of the Somme, he was so badly wounded by a shell-fragment through the lung that he was expected to die and was officially reported as having died of wounds. He gradually recovered and, apart from a brief spell back in France, spent the remainder of the war in England.One of Graves's friends at this time was the poet Siegfried Sassoon, a fellow officer in his regiment. They both convalesced at Somerville College, Oxford, which was used as a hospital for officers. How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford, Sassoon wrote to him in 1917.\nAt Somerville College, Graves met and fell in love with Marjorie, a nurse and professional pianist, but stopped writing to her once he learned she was engaged. About his time at Somerville, he wrote: \"I enjoyed my stay at Somerville. The sun shone, and the discipline was easy.\"\nIn 1917, Sassoon rebelled against the conduct of the war by making a public anti-war statement. Graves feared Sassoon could face a court martial and intervened with the military authorities, persuading them that Sassoon was suffering from shell shock and that they should treat him accordingly. As a result, Sassoon was sent to Craiglockhart, a military hospital in Edinburgh, where he was treated by Dr. W. H. R. Rivers and met fellow patient Wilfred Owen. Graves was treated here as well. Graves also suffered from shell shock, or neurasthenia as it was then called, but he was never hospitalised for it:I thought of going back to France, but realized the absurdity of the notion. Since 1916, the fear of gas obsessed me: any unusual smell, even a sudden strong scent of flowers in a garden, was enough to send me trembling. And I couldn't face the sound of heavy shelling now; the noise of a car back-firing would send me flat on my face, or running for cover.\nThe friendship between Graves and Sassoon is documented in Graves's letters and biographies; the story is fictionalised in Pat Barker's novel Regeneration. Barker also addresses Graves's experiences with homosexuality in his youth; at the end of the novel Graves asserts that his \"affections have been running in more normal channels\" after a friend was accused of \"soliciting\" with another man. The intensity of their early relationship is demonstrated in Graves's collection, Fairies and Fusiliers (1917), which contains many poems celebrating their friendship. Sassoon remarked upon a \"heavy sexual element\" within it, an observation supported by the sentimental nature of much of the surviving correspondence between the two men. Through Sassoon, Graves became a friend of Wilfred Owen, \"who often used to send me poems from France.\"In September 1917, Graves was seconded for duty with a garrison battalion. Graves's army career ended dramatically with an incident which could have led to a charge of desertion. Having been posted to Limerick in late 1918, he \"woke up with a sudden chill, which I recognized as the first symptoms of Spanish influenza.\" \"I decided to make a run for it,\" he wrote, \"I should at least have my influenza in an English, and not an Irish, hospital.\" Arriving at Waterloo with a high fever but without the official papers that would secure his release from the army, he chanced to share a taxi with a demobilisation officer also returning from Ireland, who completed his papers for him with the necessary secret codes.\nPostwar\nImmediately after the war, Graves had a wife, Nancy Nicholson, and a growing family but was financially insecure and weakened physically and mentally:\n\n Very thin, very nervous and with about four years' loss of sleep to make up, I was waiting until I got well enough to go to Oxford on the Government educational grant. I knew that it would be years before I could face anything but a quiet country life. My disabilities were many: I could not use a telephone, I felt sick every time I travelled by train, and to see more than two new people in a single day prevented me from sleeping. I felt ashamed of myself as a drag on Nancy, but had sworn on the very day of my demobilization never to be under anyone's orders for the rest of my life. Somehow I must live by writing.\nIn October 1919, he took up his place at the University of Oxford, soon changing course to English Language and Literature, though managing to retain his Classics exhibition. In consideration of his health, he was permitted to live a little outside Oxford, on Boars Hill, where the residents included Robert Bridges, John Masefield (his landlord), Edmund Blunden, Gilbert Murray and Robert Nichols. Later, the family moved to Worlds End Cottage on Collice Street, Islip, Oxfordshire. His most notable Oxford companion was T. E. Lawrence, then a Fellow of All Souls', with whom he discussed contemporary poetry and shared in the planning of elaborate pranks. By this time, he had become an atheist. His work was part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1924 Summer Olympics.While still an undergraduate he established a grocers shop on the outskirts of Oxford but the business soon failed. He also failed his BA degree but was exceptionally permitted to take a B.Litt. by dissertation instead, allowing him to pursue a teaching career. In 1926, he took up a post as a Professor of English Literature at Cairo University, accompanied by his wife, their children and the poet Laura Riding. Graves later claimed that one of his pupils was a young Gamal Abdel Nasser. He returned to London briefly, where he split up with his wife under highly emotional circumstances (at one point Riding attempted suicide) before leaving to live with Riding in Dei\u00e0, Majorca. There they continued to publish letterpress books under the rubric of the Seizin Press, founded and edited the literary journal, Epilogue and wrote two successful academic books together: A Survey of Modernist Poetry (1927) and A Pamphlet Against Anthologies (1928); both had great influence on modern literary criticism, particularly New Criticism.\nLiterary career\nIn 1927, he published Lawrence and the Arabs, a commercially successful biography of T. E. Lawrence. The autobiographical Good-Bye to All That (1929, revised by him and republished in 1957) proved a success but cost him many of his friends, notably Siegfried Sassoon. In 1934 he published his most commercially successful work, I, Claudius. Using classical sources (under the advice of classics scholar Eirlys Roberts) he constructed a complex and compelling tale of the life of the Roman emperor Claudius, a tale extended in the sequel Claudius the God (1935). The Claudius books were turned into the very popular television series I, Claudius shown in both Britain and United States in the 1970s. Another historical novel by Graves, Count Belisarius (1938), recounts the career of the Byzantine general Belisarius.\nGraves and Riding left Majorca in 1936 at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and in 1939, they moved to the United States, taking lodging in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Their volatile relationship and eventual breakup was described by Robert's nephew Richard Perceval Graves in Robert Graves: 1927\u20131940: the Years with Laura, and T. S. Matthews's Jacks or Better (1977). It was also the basis for Miranda Seymour's novel The Summer of '39 (1998).\nAfter returning to Britain, Graves began a relationship with Beryl Hodge, the wife of Alan Hodge, his collaborator on The Long Week-End (1941) and The Reader Over Your Shoulder (1943; republished in 1947 as The Use and Abuse of the English Language but subsequently republished several times under its original title). In 1946, he and Beryl (they were not to marry until 1950) re-established a home with their three children, in Dei\u00e0, Majorca. The house is now a museum. The year 1946 also saw the publication of his historical novel, King Jesus. He published The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth in 1948; it is a study of the nature of poetic inspiration, interpreted in terms of the classical and Celtic mythology he knew so well. He turned to science fiction with Seven Days in New Crete (1949) and in 1953 he published The Nazarene Gospel Restored with Joshua Podro. He also wrote Hercules, My Shipmate, published under that name in 1945 (but first published as The Golden Fleece in 1944).\nIn 1955, he published The Greek Myths, which retells a large body of Greek myths, each tale followed by extensive commentary drawn from the system of The White Goddess. His retellings are well respected; many of his unconventional interpretations and etymologies are dismissed by classicists. Graves in turn dismissed the reactions of classical scholars, arguing that they are too specialised and \"prose-minded\" to interpret \"ancient poetic meaning,\" and that \"the few independent thinkers...[are]...the poets, who try to keep civilisation alive.\"He published a volume of short stories, Catacrok! Mostly Stories, Mostly Funny, in 1956. In 1961 he became Professor of Poetry at Oxford, a post he held until 1966.\nIn 1967, Robert Graves published, together with Omar Ali-Shah, a new translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. The translation quickly became controversial; Graves was attacked for trying to break the spell of famed passages in Edward FitzGerald's Victorian translation, and L.P. Elwell-Sutton, an orientalist at Edinburgh University, maintained that the manuscript used by Ali-Shah and Graves, which Ali-Shah and his brother Idries Shah claimed had been in their family for 800 years, was a forgery. The translation was a critical disaster and Graves's reputation suffered severely due to what the public perceived as his gullibility in falling for the Shah brothers' deception.From the 1960s until his death, Robert Graves frequently exchanged letters with Spike Milligan. Many of their letters to each other are collected in the book, Dear Robert, Dear Spike.On 11 November 1985, Graves was among sixteen Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner. The inscription on the stone was written by friend and fellow Great War poet Wilfred Owen. It reads: \"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.\" Of the 16 poets, Graves was the only one still living at the time of the commemoration ceremony.\nUK government documents released in 2012 indicate that Graves turned down a CBE in 1957. In 2012 the Nobel Records were opened after 50 years, and it was revealed that Graves was among a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, along with John Steinbeck (who was that year's recipient of the prize), Lawrence Durrell, Jean Anouilh and Karen Blixen. Graves was rejected because, even though he had written several historical novels, he was still primarily seen as a poet, and committee member Henry Olsson was reluctant to award any Anglo-Saxon poet the prize before the death of Ezra Pound, believing that other writers did not match his talent.In 2017 Seven Stories Press began its Robert Graves Project. Fourteen of Graves's out-of-print books will be republished over the next three years. The Reader Over Your Shoulder was the first adult title in Graves's oeuvre, published 9 January 2018. Ann at Highwood Hall, a children's book, was published in July 2017.\n\nSexuality\nRobert Graves was bisexual, having intense romantic relationships with both men and women, though the word he coined for it was \"pseudo-homosexual.\" Graves was raised to be \"...prudishly innocent, as my mother had planned I should be.\" His mother, Amy, forbade speaking about sex, save in a \"gruesome\" context, and all skin \"must be covered.\" At his days in Penrallt, he had \"innocent crushes\" on boys; one in particular was a boy named Ronny, who \"climbed trees, killed pigeons with a catapult and broke all the school rules while never seeming to get caught.\" At Charterhouse, an all-boys school, it was common for boys to develop \"...amorous but seldom erotic\" relationships, which the headmaster mostly ignored. Graves described boxing with a friend, Raymond Rodakowski, as having a \"...a lot of sex feeling...\" And although Graves admitted to loving Raymond, he would dismiss it as \"...more comradely than amorous.\"In his fourth year at Charterhouse, Graves would meet \"Dick\" (George \"Peter\" Harcourt Johnstone) with whom he would develop \"...an even stronger relationship...\" Johnstone was an object of adoration in Graves' early poems. Graves' feelings for Johnstone were exploited by bullies, who led Graves to believe that Johnstone was seen kissing the choir-master. Graves, jealous, demanded the choir-master's resignation. During the First World War, Johnstone remained a \"solace\" to Graves. Despite Graves' own \"pure and innocent\" view of Johnstone, Graves' cousin Gerald wrote in a letter that Johnstone was: \"not at all the innocent fellow I took him for, but as bad as anyone could be...\" Johnstone remained a subject for Graves' poems despite this. Communication between them ended when Johnstone's mother found their letters and forbade further contact with Graves. Johnstone would later be arrested for attempting to seduce a Canadian soldier, which removed Graves' denial about Johnstone's infidelity, causing Graves to collapse.In 1917, Graves met Marjorie Machin, an auxiliary nurse from Kent. He admired her \"...direct manner and practical approach to life...\" Graves did not pursue the relationship when he realised Machin had a fianc\u00e9 on the Front. This began a period where Graves would begin to take interest in women with more masculine traits. Nancy Nicholson, his future wife, was an ardent feminist: she kept her hair short, wore trousers, and had \"boyish directness and youth.\" Her feminism never conflicted with Graves' own ideas of female superiority. Siegfried Sassoon, who felt as if Graves and he had a relationship of a fashion, felt betrayed by Graves' new relationship and declined to go to the wedding. Graves apparently never loved Sassoon in the same fashion that Sassoon loved Graves.Graves' and Nicholson's marriage was strained, with Graves living with \"shell shock\" and having an insatiable need for sex that Nicholson did not return. Nancy, by extension forbade any mention of the war, which added to the conflict. In 1926, he would meet Laura Riding, with whom he would run away in 1929 while still married to Nicholson. Prior to this, Graves, Riding and Nicholson would attempt a triadic relationship called \"The Trinity.\" Despite the implications, Riding and Nicholson were most likely straight. This triangle became the \"Holy Circle\" with the addition of Irish poet, Geoffrey Phibbs. This relationship revolved around the worship and reverence of Riding. Graves and Phibbs were both to sleep with Riding. When Phibbs attempted to leave the relationship, Graves was sent to track him down, even threatening to kill Phibbs if he did not return to the circle. When Phibbs resisted, Laura threw herself out of a window, with Graves following suit to reach her. Graves' commitment to Riding was so strong that he entered, on her word, a period of enforced celibacy, \"which he had not enjoyed.\"By 1938, no longer entranced by Riding, Graves fell in love with the then married Beryl Hodge. In 1950, after much dispute with Nicholson (whom he had not divorced yet,) he married Beryl. Despite having a loving marriage with Beryl, Graves would take on a 17-year-old muse, Judith Bledsoe, in 1950. Although the relationship would be described as \"not overtly sexual\", Graves would later in 1952 attack Judith's new fianc\u00e9, getting the police called on him the process. He would later have three successive female muses, who came to dominate his poetry.\nDeath and legacy\nDeath\nDuring the early 1970s Graves began to suffer from increasingly severe memory loss. By his 80th birthday in 1975, he had come to the end of his working life. He lived for another decade, in an increasingly dependent condition, until he died from heart failure on 7 December 1985 at the age of 90 years. His body was buried the next morning in the small churchyard on a hill at Dei\u00e0, at the site of a shrine that had once been sacred to the White Goddess of Pelion. His second wife, Beryl Graves, died on 27 October 2003 and her body was interred in the same grave.\nMemorials\nThree of his former houses have a blue plaque on them: in Wimbledon, Brixham, and Islip.\nChildren\nRobert Graves had eight children. With his first wife, Nancy Nicholson, he had Jennie (who married journalist Alexander Clifford), David (who was killed in the Second World War), Catherine (who married nuclear scientist Clifford Dalton at Aldershot), and Sam. With his second wife, Beryl Pritchard (1915\u20132003), he had William, Lucia (a translator), Juan, and Tom\u00e1s (a writer and musician).\nBibliography\nSee also\nEnglish translations of Homer \u00a7\u00a0GravesReferences\nSources\nGraves, Robert (1960).

With Marjorie Barnard she formed the writing collaboration known as M. Barnard Eldershaw. She was also a teacher and later a public servant.\nEldershaw was active in Australian literary circles, including becoming the first woman President of the Fellowship of Australian Writers and being a long-time member of the Advisory Board of the Commonwealth Literary Fund. For both her writing output and her active support for and promotion of writers, Eldershaw made a significant contribution to Australian literary life.\n\nLife\nEldershaw was born in Sydney but grew up in the Riverina district of country New South Wales. She was the fifth of eight children born to Henry Sirdefield Eldershaw, a station manager, and Margaret (n\u00e9e McCarroll). She attended boarding school at Mount Erin Convent in Wagga Wagga.\nAfter school, she studied history and Latin at the University of Sydney where she met Marjorie Barnard with whom she later formed a writing collaboration, under the name M. Barnard Eldershaw. She worked as a teacher, first at Cremorne Church of England Grammar and then, from 1923, at Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon, where she became senior English mistress and head of the boarding school. According to Dever, her Catholic education precluded her becoming headmistress. In 1941, she moved to Canberra to take up a government position, transferring to Melbourne in 1943 where she worked for the Department of Labour and National Service. In 1948 she started working as a private consultant in industrial matters such as women's legal rights and equal pay, and extending her interests into the welfare of Aboriginal and migrant women.Like many women writers of the time, she had to work to support her writing activities. Like them too, she faced difficulties about where to live. For a time she lived as a resident mistress at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, but came to hate the restrictions this entailed. Barnard, herself living under the restrictions of home, described Eldershaw's situation as \"untenable\". In 1936 Eldershaw and Barnard rented a small flat in Potts Point where they could give small dinner parties and to which they could retreat from school and home. In 1938 she moved out of school completely into a better flat in King's Cross. During this time, these flats operated as something like a literary salon, as it was here that Eldershaw and Barnard were able to entertain many of their literary peers.\nLike Barnard, she never married. As her health failed due to \"years of overwork and financial worries\", she went to her sister's place in 1955. Ironically, she was granted one of the literary pensions she had fought hard to establish a decade earlier. She died in hospital of a cerebral thrombosis in 1956.\n\nLiterary career\nEldershaw was a leading figure in Sydney literary circles, becoming, in 1935, the first woman president of the Fellowship of Australian Writers (FAW), a position she held again in 1943. As Dever writes, \"With Barnard and Frank Dalby Davison, she developed policies on political and cultural issues, and helped to transform the F.A.W. into a vocal and sometimes controversial lobby group\". Through the late 1930s, these three were known as \"the triumvirate\". Besides these two, her literary associates included Vance and Nettie Palmer, Katharine Susannah Prichard, Judah Waten and Tom Inglis Moore.\nIt is well recognised that during the interwar years in Australia \"women represented a significant section of the writing community\", that, in fact, this concentration \"could be said to be one of the major distinguishing features of the then Australian literary landscape\". Women, including Eldershaw, were significant in the reviewing community, held office in major literary societies, judged literary competitions and edited anthologies.\nEldershaw actively promoted the needs of writers and in 1938 helped persuade the Commonwealth Literary Fund (CLF) to include grants and pensions for writers, and funding for university lectures on Australian literature. She was a member of the CLF from 1939 to 1953. In much of this more political, advocacy work she was often the only woman present. She was known to Australian politicians like H. V. Evatt, Ben Chifley and Robert Menzies. Dever writes that Vance Palmer admired Eldershaw for \"what he saw as her ability to neutralise conventional masculine expectation of the threat posed by women in 'public life'\", though she suggests that he failed to recognise that she often achieved this by playing on men's expectations.\nCollaboration\nHer major fiction output was produced in collaboration with Marjorie Barnard. Their first novel, A House is Built (1929) shared first prize, with Katharine Susannah Prichard's Coonardoo, in the Bulletin novel competition. They wrote four other novels, the last being the censored utopian novel, published in 1947 as Tomorrow and Tomorrow, and reissued in its entirety in 1983 under its original title, Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow (1947).\nThe collaboration, which lasted two decades, also produced histories, critical essays and lectures, and radio drama.\n\nPublic Service career\nEldershaw left teaching, disillusioned, and obtained employment with the Department of Labour and National Service. She worked first in the Division of Post-War Reconstruction and then in the Division of Industrial Welfare. She developed some of Australia's first policies on industrial welfare and undertook comprehensive research into personnel practice in government munitions factories and private industry.However, being unable to obtain permanent employment in the Public Service for health reasons, she found work as a private management consultant. This was to prove disastrous financially as her employer often didn't pay her.\nPolitics\nPolitics was always an important aspect of her work. Realising that \"to be involved in writing was to be involved in politics\", she, Barnard and Davison worked hard through the Fellowship of Australian Writers to protect writers and the freedom of expression. She lobbied for writers to receive Federal government subsidies. The \"salon\" she and Barnard held in Sydney in the late 1930s hosted not only writers but also peace activists such as Lewis Rodd and Lloyd Ross.During the war years, Eldershaw documented cases in which police raids on individuals and left-wing organisations resulted in the confiscation of property, arguing that writers must have \"in their libraries all shades of opinion as tools of the trade\". She strongly supported the FAW's pro-Soviet stance and, with Katharine Susannah Prichard, Miles Franklin and Frank Dalby Davison, was invited to speak at the Cultural Conference of the NSW Aid Russia Committee. As FAW President in 1943, she conveyed a message of support for Soviet writers to the Soviet Consul in Canberra.Dever quotes Melbourne writer John Morrison as saying that Eldershaw was \"socially and politically inclined to the left\" and says that her pro-Soviet position and involvement in the Peace Movement resulted in her having \"a slim if predictable ASIO file\".\nSelected works\nFiction\nAs M.

She went to school and university in Sydney, and then trained as a librarian. She was employed as a librarian for two periods in her life (1923\u20131935 and 1942\u20131950), but her main passion was writing.\nBarnard met her collaborator, Flora Eldershaw (1897\u20131956), at the University of Sydney, and they published their first novel, A House is Built in 1929. Their collaboration spanned the next two decades, and covered the full range of their writing: fiction, history and literary criticism. They published under the pseudonym M. Barnard Eldershaw. Marjorie Barnard was a significant part of the literary scene in Australia between the wars and, for both her work as M. Barnard Eldershaw and in her own right, is recognised as a major figure in Australian letters.\nLife\nBarnard was born in Ashfield, Sydney, to Ethel Frances and Oswald Holme Barnard, and was their only surviving child. She had polio as a child and was taught by a governess until she was 10 years old. She then attended the Cambridge School and Sydney Girls High School. After high school, she went to the University of Sydney, from which she graduated with first class honours and the first University Medal for History in 1918. She was offered a scholarship to Oxford, but her father refused her permission to go, and so she trained as a librarian at the Sydney Teachers' College. She worked as a librarian at the Public Library of New South Wales and then the Sydney Technical College until 1935 when she left to write full-time, at the encouragement of her friend, writer and literary critic, Nettie Palmer, and made possible through a small allowance from her father. She wrote to Nettie Palmer at the time that she was seeking \"some sort of fulfilment, to run my vital energy into a creative mould instead of just letting it soak into the thirsty sand of a daily round\".She joined the Fellowship of Australian Writers in 1935, of which Flora Eldershaw was President for a couple of terms. During the next five years, she, Flora Eldershaw and Frank Dalby Davison were known as \"the triumvirate\" for their joint work on political and cultural policy. As well as Flora Eldershaw and Frank Dalby Davison, Marjorie Barnard knew many of the leading writers of her time, including Vance and Nettie Palmer, Miles Franklin, Katharine Susannah Prichard, Eleanor Dark, Xavier Herbert and Patrick White.\nBarnard travelled overseas several times, the first time in 1933 with her mother. She loved travel but in 1986 stated that \"I think it's dangerous for writers to leave their roots. I am\u2014was\u2014an Australian writer\".In the late 1930s, though she still lived at home, she and Flora Eldershaw took a flat in Potts Point where they held regular gatherings which operated something like a literary salon. Many of the leading literary and cultural figures of the time visited the flat, and it was here that she was able to spend time with Frank Dalby Davison whom she admitted many years later had been her love. She wrote of this relationship to her writer friend, Jean Devanny, \"I was deeply in love with him ... We were lovers for eight years ... In 1942 I knew things were coming to an end ... I was, as he said, very na\u00efve\". She admitted to Devanny that the break-up of this relationship was the cause of a serious illness.Her father died in 1940, leaving her with an ailing mother. She returned to library work in 1942, at the Public Library of New South Wales and then the CSIRO. However, her mother's death in 1949 left her 'modestly independent' enabling her to leave work in 1950.Marjorie Barnard never married, and destroyed essentially all her correspondence. However, several of her correspondents, particularly Nettie Palmer and Jean Devanny, kept her letters to them, and some of these are now held in Australian libraries and archives, such as the National Library of Australia.She died at Point Clare on the Central Coast of New South Wales, in 1987, aged 89.\n\nCareer\nMarjorie Barnard's writing career spanned four decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, with the majority of her works being written in the 1930s-1940s, a period in Australia noted for its flowering of women writers. Despite this, in an interview in 1986, she stated that there was no such thing as a \"woman writer\", that \"there are writers good and bad. Only the work counts\". In the same interview, she also said, \"I never achieved what I set out to do; I never achieved the goals I set myself for each book. I suppose the only exception to that would be The Persimmon Tree\". She wrote little in the last twenty years of her life.\n\nCollaboration\nBarnard's writing career was inspired by her meeting Flora Eldershaw in her first year at university, and her first work was a children's book, The Ivory Gate, published in 1920. However, on seeing an advertisement for The Bulletin prize, she and Eldershaw wrote their first collaborative novel, A House is Built, which went on to win the prize in 1928, shared with Katharine Susannah Prichard's Coonardoo.\nUsing the pseudonym M. Barnard Eldershaw, they wrote five novels, as well as a wide range of non-fiction works including histories and criticisms, such as their well-regarded Essays in Australian Fiction (1938). This book contained essays on Henry Handel Richardson, Katharine Susannah Prichard, Leonard Mann, Martin Boyd (under his pseudonym Martin Mills), Christina Stead and Eleanor Dark.\nTheir final collaborative novel was Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow. It was published in 1945 as Tomorrow and Tomorrow. It is considered to be one of Australia's major early science fiction novels and was highly regarded by Australia's only Nobel Prize winner for literature, Patrick White. However, it was censored for political reasons at the time and was not published in its entirety until Virago Press reissued it in 1983.While it is generally accepted that Barnard was the more expressive writer of the two, and that Eldershaw contributed her acute critical sense, Rorabacher also states that in their early collaborative novels it is impossible to distinguish their separate contributions. Overall, Barnard did more of the creative writing while Eldershaw focused on the structure and development of their major works. However, because Eldershaw was the more outgoing and articulate of the two, it was frequently assumed, at the time, that she was the dominant partner. This did not spoil their partnership, which lasted two decades, bearing testament to the fact that both derived value from it.\nSolo career\nBarnard's most successful fictional work written in her own right is The Persimmon Tree and Other Stories (1943). It was reissued by Virago in 1985, with the inclusion of three additional stories not previously published in book form. The title story, The Persimmon Tree, is one of Australia's most anthologised stories. The stories were published soon after the end of her relationship with Davison, and were seen by Barnard as some \"compensation for the hurt that was integral to their production\". As Dever writes, \"stories such as 'The Persimmon Tree', 'The Woman Who Did the Right Thing' and 'Beauty is Strength' take as their themes the consequences of illicit love, rivalry between women and the withdrawal and stoicism sometimes demanded of injured lovers\".After Eldershaw's death, Barnard continued to write, mostly histories and literary criticism, including, in 1967, the first biography of Miles Franklin. She admired Franklin's character and energy but was less enamoured of her literary abilities, writing that 'her writings are eclipsed by her personality' and that 'she was no philosopher, displayed little skill in constructing her books, and not much originality in plot.'Her History of Australia, published in 1963, was well-reviewed at the time. One reviewer compared it favourably with histories by Keith Hancock, A.G.L. Shaw, Max Crawford and Douglas Pike, writing that she \"writes good narrative prose and avoids, on the whole, analysis, although she can provide good commonsense summaries (as on the convict tradition or the Federation movement) when she wishes\". He goes on to say that \"her argument is not original, but she states it with clarity, a well-calculated density of detail, and with authority, especially when she writes on the subject she knows best, Macquarie's world\". He does however note that there are some errors and inconsistencies, and gaps in the bibliography.\nPolitics\nWhile she never joined a political party, she was affected by the social and political upheavals of the 1930s. During this period, Barnard, Eldershaw and Frank Dalby Davison worked together to ensure the Fellowship of Australian Writers (FAW) functioned as a trade union of professional writers and that it adopted progressive positions on political questions. It was this work that resulted in their being known as 'the triumvirate'. Fiona Capp writes, for example, that through the FAW Barnard and Eldershaw actively lobbied against National Security regulations and infringements on the freedom of speech.Barnard regarded herself as a 'nineteenth century liberal' and defined herself as a pacifist. In 1940, she joined the Peace Pledge Union. She edited a collection of essays defending freedom, which was not published, and a pamphlet The Case for the Future, which was banned by the censor. She also joined the Australian Labor Party as confirmed in several letters to Nettie Palmer, although later denied that she had ever joined. Dever suggests that this denial may be due to the Cold War witch hunts of the 1950s in which her name, among others, was mentioned. She suggests that Barnard received more criticism at that time than Eldershaw, who was frequently defended as a member of the CLF Advisory Board, and that, not being fond of publicity, she was likely to have been \"deeply disturbed\" by \"the accusations and embarrassingly public attention\".\nFAW Marjorie Barnard Short Story Award\nBarnard provided for a biennial prize in her will, in which $500 is offered as first prize for a short story of 3,000 words. When Yasmine Gooneratne won the award in 1991, it was titled the Marjorie Barnard Literary Award for Fiction.\n2017: Gabrielle Leago: \"The Dark Road Home\"\n2015: Dorothy Simmons: \"Count Down\"\n2009: Sharyn Munro: \"Live at the Bellevue\"\n2007: Geoffrey Dean: \"The Man Who Forgot Himself\"\n2005: Jacqueline Winn: \"Once More with Feeling\"\nCarolline Rhodes\n1999: Antonia Hildebrand: \"To Breathe\"\n1997: Helen Armstrong: \"Encounter at Arkadi\"\n1991: Yasmine Gooneratne: A Change of Skies (novel)Honours and awards\n1928: The Bulletin Prize\n1980: Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM)\n1983: Patrick White Award\n1984: NSW Premier's Special Award\n1986: Honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Sydney.Selected works\nFiction\nAs Marjorie Barnard\nThe Persimmon Tree, and Other Stories (1943)As M.

His best known works include his first book of poetry, Blue Juniata (1929), his lyrical memoir, Exile's Return (1934; rev. 1951), as a chronicler and fellow traveller of the Lost Generation, and as an influential editor and talent scout at Viking Press.\n\nEarly life\nCowley was born August 24, 1898, in Belsano, Cambria County, Pennsylvania, to William Cowley and Josephine Hutmacher. He grew up in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh, where his father, William, was a homeopathic doctor. Cowley attended Shakespeare Street elementary school and in 1915 graduated from Peabody High School, where his boyhood friend Kenneth Burke was also a student. Cowley's first published writing appeared in his high school newspaper.He attended Harvard University, but his studies were interrupted when he joined the American Field Service during World War I to drive ambulances and munitions trucks for the French army. He returned to Harvard in 1919 and became editor of The Harvard Advocate. He graduated with a B.A. in 1920.\nLife in Paris\nCowley was one of the many literary and artistic figures who migrated to Paris in the 1920s. He became one of the best-known chroniclers of the American expatriates in Europe, as he frequently spent time with writers like Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, E. E. Cummings, Edmund Wilson, Erskine Caldwell, and others associated with American literary modernism. In Blue Juniata, Cowley described these Americans who travelled abroad during the postwar period as a \"wandering, landless, uprooted generation\"; similarly Hemingway, claiming to have taken the phrase from Gertrude Stein, called them the \"lost generation\". This sense of uprootedness deeply affected Cowley's appreciation for the necessities of artistic freedom. It moreover informed his ideal of cosmopolitanism in contrast to the fervent nationalism(s) that had led to World War I. Cowley recounted his experiences in  Exile's Return, writing, \"our whole training was involuntarily directed toward destroying whatever roots we had in the soil, toward eradicating our local and regional peculiarities, toward making us homeless citizens of the world\".While Cowley associated with many American writers in Europe, the sense of admiration was not always mutual. Hemingway removed direct reference to Cowley in a later version of The Snows of Kilimanjaro, replacing his name with the description, \"that American poet with a pile of saucers in front of him and a stupid look on his potato face talking about the Dada movement\". John Dos Passos's private correspondence revealed the contempt he held for Cowley, but also the care writers took to hide their personal feelings in order to protect their careers once Cowley had become an editor of The New Republic. Regardless, Exile's Return was one of the first autobiographical texts to foreground the American expatriate experience. Despite not selling well during its first publication, it established Cowley as one of the most trenchant emissaries of the Lost Generation. Literary historian Van Wyck Brooks described Exile's Return as \"an irreplaceable literary record of the most dramatic period in American literary history.\"\nEarly Career and Involvement in Politics\nWhile in Paris, Cowley found himself drawn to the avant-garde sensibilities of Dada, and also, like many other intellectuals of the period, to Marxism and its attempts to demystify the socioeconomic and political conditions that had plunged Europe into a devastating war. He travelled frequently between Paris and Greenwich Village in New York, and through these intersecting social circles came into close proximity, though he never officially joined, with the U.S. Communist Party. In 1929, Cowley became an associate editor of the left-leaning magazine The New Republic, which he steered in \"a resolutely communist direction\" The same year, he translated and wrote a foreword to the 1913 French novel 'La Colline Inspir\u00e9e', by Maurice Barr\u00e8s. By the early 1930s, Cowley became increasingly involved in radical politics. In 1932, he joined Edmund Wilson, Mary Heaton Vorse, and Waldo Frank as union-sponsored observers of the miners' strikes in Kentucky. Their lives were threatened by the mines' owners, and Frank was badly beaten. When Exile's Return was first published in 1934, it put forth a distinctly Marxist interpretation of history and social struggle.\nIn 1935, Cowley helped to establish a leftist collective, The League of American Writers. Other notable members included Archibald MacLeish, Upton Sinclair, Clifford Odets, Langston Hughes, Carl Sandburg, Carl Van Doren, Waldo Frank, David Ogden Stewart, John Dos Passos, Lillian Hellman, and Dashiell Hammett. Cowley was appointed Vice President, and over the next few years became involved in numerous campaigns, including attempts to persuade the United States government to support the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He resigned in 1940, owing to concerns that the organization was too heavily influenced by the Communist Party.\nIn 1941, near the outset of the United States' involvement in World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Cowley's associate, poet and \"popular front\" interventionist Archibald MacLeish, as head of the War Department's Office of Facts and Figures (precursor to the Office of War Information). MacLeish recruited Cowley as an analyst. This decision resulted in anti-communist journalists such as Whittaker Chambers and Westbrook Pegler publicly exposing Cowley's left-wing sympathies. Cowley soon found himself in the crosshairs of congressman Martin Dies (D-Tex.) and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Dies accused Cowley of belonging to seventy-two communist or communist-front organizations. This number was certainly an exaggeration, but Cowley had no recourse to deny it. MacLeish soon came under pressure from J. Edgar Hoover and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to dismiss Cowley. In January 1942, MacLeish sent his reply that the FBI needed a course of instruction in history. \"Don't you think it would be a good thing if all investigators could be made to understand that Liberalism is not only not a crime but actually the attitude of the President of the United States and the greater part of his Administration?\", he said. Nevertheless, Cowley resigned two months later, vowing to never write about politics again.\n\nEditorial Career and Academia\nIn 1944, having been more or less silenced politically, Cowley began a career as a literary advisor, editor, and talent scout at Viking Press. He was hired to work on the Portable Library series, which had started in 1943 with As You Were: A Portable Library of American Prose and Poetry Assembled for Members of the Armed Forces and Merchant Marine. In its inception, the Portable Library was an anthology of paperback reprints that could be mass-produced cheaply and marketed to military personnel. It also emphasized an American literary tradition that could be construed as patriotic during wartime. Yet Cowley was able to steer the series toward what were, in his esteem, underappreciated writers.\nHe first set out to edit The Portable Hemingway (1944). At the time, Hemingway was largely considered to be a sparse and simplistic writer. Cowley departed from this perception in his introductory essay, claiming instead that Hemingway could be read as tortured and submerged. This revaluation remains the dominant critical opinion today. Literary critic Mark McGurl argues that Hemingway's tip-of-the-iceberg style has become one of the most emulated in twentieth-century American prose, his name all but synonymous with the \"pathos of understatement\" and \"the value of craft as represented by the practice of multiple revision\".The Portable Hemingway sold so well that Cowley was able to convince Viking to publish a Portable Faulkner in 1946. William Faulkner was, at the time, slipping into literary obscurity. By the 1930s, he was working as a Hollywood screenwriter and in danger of seeing his works go out of print. Cowley again argued for a dramatic revaluation of Faulkner's position in American letters, enlisting him as an honorary member of the Lost Generation. Robert Penn Warren called The Portable Faulkner the \"great watershed\" moment for Faulkner's reputation, and many scholars view Cowley's essay as having resuscitated Faulkner's career. Faulkner won a Nobel Prize in 1949. He later said, \"I owe Malcolm Cowley the kind of debt no man could ever repay\".Cowley then published a revised edition of Exile's Return in 1951. The revisions downplayed some of the more overtly Marxist tenets, and more obviously emphasized the return of the exile as a necessary step toward reestablishing a nation's solidarity: \"the old pattern of alienation and reintegration, or departure and return, that is repeated in scores of European myths and continually re-embodied in life\", Cowley wrote. This time the book sold much better. Cowley also published a Portable Hawthorne (1948), The Literary Tradition (1954), and edited a new edition of Leaves of Grass (1959), by Walt Whitman. These were followed by Black Cargoes, A History of the Atlantic Slave Trade (1962), Fitzgerald and the Jazz Age (1966), Think Back on Us (1967), Collected Poems (1968), Lesson of the Masters (1971) and A Second Flowering (1973).\nCowley taught creative writing at the college-level beginning in the 1950s. Among his students were Larry McMurtry, Peter S. Beagle, Wendell Berry, as well as Ken Kesey, whose One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1962) Cowley helped publish at Viking. Writing workshops were a recent development at the time (the Iowa Writers' Workshop was founded in 1936), yet by midcentury their proliferation was of note for both writers and publishers. Cowley taught also at Yale, Michigan, Minnesota, Washington, California at Irvine and Berkeley, and even the prestigious Stegner Fellowship at Stanford, among other places, but he seldom maintained a full-time teaching appointment. Literary and cultural critic Benjamin Kirbach argues that this flitting back-and-forth between universities and the publishing industry allowed Cowley to reconcile his cosmopolitan ideal within the constraints of the academy. Kirbach writes: \"Cowley's itinerancy\u2014his seemingly effortless movement between universities and the publishing industry, between writers individual and collective\u2014played a crucial role in institutionalizing [literary] modernism\" in the twentieth century.As an editorial consultant to Viking Press, he pushed for the publication of Jack Kerouac's On the Road. Cowley's work anthologizing 28 Fitzgerald short stories and editing a reissue of Tender Is the Night, restructured based on Fitzgerald's notes, both in 1951, were key to reviving Fitzgerald's reputation as well, and his introduction to Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio, written in the early 1960s, is said to have had a similar effect on Anderson's reputation.  Other works of literary and critical importance include Eight More Harvard Poets (1923), A Second Flowering: Works & Days of the Lost Generation (1973), And I Worked at the Writer's Trade (1978), and The Dream of the Golden Mountains: Remembering the 1930s (1980).And I Worked won a 1980 U.S. National Book Award in the one-year category Autobiography.When  The Portable Malcolm Cowley (Donald Faulkner, editor) was published in 1990, the year after Cowley's death, Michael Rogers wrote in Library Journal:  \"Though a respected name in hardcore literary circles, in general the late Cowley is one of the unsung heroes of 20th-century American literature. Poet, critic, Boswell of the Lost Generation of which he himself was a member, savior of Faulkner's dwindling reputation, editor of Kerouac's On the Road, discoverer of John Cheever, Cowley knew everybody and wrote about them with sharp insight. . . . . Cowley's writings on the great books are as important as the books themselves . . . . All American literature collections should own this.\"To the end, Cowley remained a humanitarian in the world of letters. He wrote writer Louise Bogan in 1941, \"I'm almost getting pathologically tender-hearted. I have been caused so much pain by reviewers and political allrightniks of several shades of opinion that I don't want to cause pain to anybody.\"\nMarriages and death\nCowley married artist Peggy Baird; they were divorced in 1931. His second wife was Muriel Maurer.  Together they had one son, Robert William Cowley, who is an editor and military historian.He died of a heart attack March 27, 1989.\nCorrespondence\nMalcolm, Cowley, The Long Voyage: Selected Letters of Malcolm Cowley, 1915\u20131987, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2014\nPaul, Jay (1989).

She is best known for her autobiographical fiction and involvement in proletarian and women's liberation movements.Miyamoto began writing while she was still in school. She traveled for several years to the United States and the Soviet Union before returning to Japan, where her works were heavily censored and she was imprisoned repeatedly for her political views. She founded and operated a number of proletarian and feminist magazines during her career, many of which were also censored.\nHer works include Nobuko, Bansh\u016b heiya (The Bansh\u016b Plain), F\u016bchis\u014d (The Weathervane Plant), and other works of fiction and literary criticism. Much of her work is autobiographical and centers around themes of war, class, and gender relations. She and her husband, Miyamoto Kenji, continue to be honored by the Japanese Left for their vision and commitment toward Japanese women and the working class.Her maiden name was Ch\u016bj\u014d (\u4e2d\u689d) Yuriko.\nBiography\nEarly life\nMiyamoto Yuriko was born Ch\u016bj\u014d Yuriko on 13 February 1899 in the Koishikawa district of Tokyo (now part of Bunky\u014d district) to privileged parents. Her father was a Cambridge and Tokyo Imperial University-trained architect, and her mother was a former painter, whose career had halted when she discovered that Ueno National Art School did not accept women. Miyamoto's mother had no intention of forcing her into the Good Wife, Wise Mother role encouraged by the Meiji government.Miyamoto attended Ochanomizu Girls' Middle School. She was aware at an early age of the differences between her own circumstances and those of the sharecroppers who worked her family's land, as shown in her early work \"N\u014dson\" (\"Farming Village\"), which drew on many of the same influences as her later work \"Mazushiki hitobito no mure\" (\"A Crowd of Poor People\"). Miyamoto's concern for differences in social and economic status drew her towards socialism, and later towards the early Japanese feminist movement.\nMiyamoto took an early interest in literature, including both Japanese writers, such as Higuchi Ichiy\u014d, Futabatei Shimei, and Natsume S\u014dseki, and non-Japanese writers, including Oscar Wilde, Edgar Allan Poe, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Leo Tolstoy. While in her teens and a freshman in the English literature department of Japan Women's University, she wrote the short story \"Mazushiki hitobito no mure\" (\"A Crowd of Poor People\"), which was accepted for publication in the prestigious Ch\u016b\u014d K\u014dron (Central Forum) literary magazine in September 1916. Her story won a literary prize sponsored by the Shirakaba (White Birch) literary circle and was endorsed by Tsubouchi Sh\u014dy\u014d.\nTravel to United States and first marriage\nIn 1918, Miyamoto left the university without graduating and traveled to the United States with her father. She went to New York, where she studied at Columbia University and met her first husband, Araki Shigeru, with whom she would return to Japan. She broke a number of social norms, including entering a love marriage, proposing herself, and refusing to take her husband's surname. The two were different in terms of age, socio-economic class, and intellectual interests, and the couple divorced in 1924, inspiring her semi-autobiographical Nobuko (1924\u20131926), which criticizes conventional ideas of gender and love as it relates the failure of the protagonist's marriage, her travels abroad, and her quest for independence. Considered a feminist I-novel, it was serialized in the journal Kaizo (Re-creation) from 1924 through 1926 before being published as a book in 1928.Upon her return to Japan, Miyamoto met Russian-language scholar Yuasa Yoshiko, through a mutual writing friend Nogami Yaeko. The two bonded over their mutual interest in Russian literature, particularly Chekhov, and Miyamoto contemplated dedicating Nobuko to Yuasa, with whom she entered into an intimate relationship after the failure of her marriage in 1924. The first few years of their relationship provided inspiration for another semi-autobiographical story, \"Ippon no hana\" (One Flower), which Miyamoto published in 1927.\nTravel to Soviet Union and second marriage\nIn 1927, Miyamoto and Yuasa traveled to the Soviet Union, where they lived together for three more years. In Moscow, they studied the Russian language and Russian literature and developed a friendship with noted movie director Sergei Eisenstein. Yuasa dedicated herself to Russian translation, while Miyamoto observed the advancement of women in the Communist state.Miyamoto and Yuasa returned to Japan in November 1930. Upon return, their relationship became rocky, in part due to the social pressures on women at the time; Yuasa openly identified as lesbian, while Miyamoto struggled with the place of female love in modernizing Japan, as she would express in later works. This disagreement was exacerbated by Yoshiko's violent outbursts and accusations of Miyamoto's dishonesty, which are evidenced by both women's correspondences.Upon their return to Japan, Miyamoto became editor of the Marxist literary journal Hataraku Fujin (Working Women) and a leading figure in the proletarian literature movement. She also joined the Japan Proletarian Writers' League and the Japan Communist Party, through which she met its secretary-general, the communist literary critic and her future husband Miyamoto Kenji. She separated from Yuasa and married Miyamoto Kenji in 1932, a transition which has been interpreted as less romantic than dutiful.\nCensorship in Japan\nIn February 1930, following an anarchist-Bolshevik debate (ana-boru rons\u014d), Miyamoto Yuriko, along with Takamure Itsue, Yagi Akiko, and other editors who preferred anarchism, separated from women's literary magazine Nyonin geijutsu (Women's Arts) to form their own journal Fujin sensen (Ladies' Front). However, with government enforcement of the Peace Preservation Laws and the increasingly severe suppression of leftist political movements, Miyamoto's works were heavily censored and her magazine was forbidden to publish.\nIn 1932, both Miyamoto Yuriko and Miyamoto Kenji were arrested alongside other Communist writers. Miyamoto was repeatedly arrested and harassed by the police and spent more than two years in prison between 1932 and 1942. Her husband, Miyamoto Kenji, was arrested again in December 1933 and held in prison until August 1945. During this time, she wrote a large number of essays and stories detailing the struggles of Communists in 1930's Japan, including \"Kokukoku\" (\"Moment by Moment\"), which was not published until after her death and describes the tortures endured by Communist prisoners.During Miyamoto Kenji's imprisonment, Miyamoto Yuriko rekindled her friendship with Yuasa Yoshiko, though they did not resume their previous intimacy. Miyamoto Yuriko remained faithful to both her husband and to Communism, which for her had become intertwined. She was arrested in 1942 and suffered from heat stroke during police interrogation, sending her health into decline. However, both she and her husband were committed to their cause and never recanted their beliefs.\nPost-war\nIn the post-war period, Miyamoto Yuriko reunited with her husband and resumed Communist political activities. This period was the most prolific in her literary career.\nIn 1946, Miyamoto wrote \"Utagoe yo okore\" for the new Japanese Literature Association; this essay urged writers to reflect on the nation's history, their own lived experience, and people's rights. In this essay and others, she advocated for twenty guaranteed rights, of which three would be adopted into the new Japanese Constitution (art. 14 cl. 1 & art. 24 cl. 1-2).Within a year of the end of the war, she published two companion novels, Bansh\u016b heiya (The Bansh\u016b Plain) and F\u016bchis\u014d (The Weathervane Plant), both descriptive of her experiences in the months immediately following the surrender of Japan. The former novel received the Mainichi Cultural Prize for 1947.\nLater life and death\nMiyamoto's health declined gradually after her heat stroke in 1942, which had impaired her vision and her heart. She died of sepsis in 1951, shortly after finishing her last novel D\u014dhy\u014d, as a complication due to acute meningitis. Her grave is at Kodaira Cemetery in Kodaira city on the outskirts of Tokyo.\n\nWritings\nMiyamoto's first novel, Nobuko, follows the titular character, who, like Miyamoto, is married in New York and returns to Japan. Her husband claims devotion but speaks differently in his actions, while her mother criticizes the marriage, and Nobuko's creativity dulls until she ultimately joins the proletarian movement and leaves her husband. The novel touches many themes that were hotly contested at the time, including the possibility of \"love marriage.\" The novel is considered mostly autobiographical and was initially received with middling acclaim; however, it enjoyed surprising re-invigoration in the post-war era. Originally seen as a story about a woman seeking self-fulfillment through love and subsequent divorce, it came to be re-interpreted as a story of a woman's liberation from a male-centric life narrative.Bansh\u016b heiya (The Bansh\u016b Plain, 1947) is a soberly detailed account of Japan in August and September 1945. The opening chapter of The Bansh\u016b Plain depicts the day of Japan's surrender. The setting is a rural town in northern Japan, where Miyamoto, represented by the protagonist Hiroko, was living as an evacuee at the war's end. The chapter captures the sense of confusion with which many Japanese received the news of surrender\u2014Hiroko's brother cannot explain what is happening to his children, while local farmers become drunk. Miyamoto depicts a \"moral bankruptcy\" which is the major theme of the novel and which is shown as the most tragic legacy of the war.\nF\u016bchis\u014d (The Weathervane Plant, 1947) provides a thinly fictionalized account of Miyamoto's reunion with her husband after his release from twelve years of wartime imprisonment. The couple's adjustment to living together again is shown as often painful. Despite many years of activism in the socialist women's movement, she is hurt when her husband indicates that she has become too tough and too independent after living alone during the war.\nFutatsu no niwa (Two Gardens, 1948) and D\u014dhy\u014d (Signposts, 1950) were written as sequels to Nobuko. The first concerns Nobuko's relationship to her wealthy family and her development as a socialist woman writer, and the second follows Nobuko's divorce and social growth in the Soviet Union. Both novels were criticized by Yuasa Yoshiko, who claimed the novels undermined the significance of female relationships, and some scholars have agreed that the novels are an indictment of Miyamoto and Yuasa's earlier relationship.Along with her short stories, Miyamoto also published a collection of essays and literary criticism Fujin to Bungaku (Women and Literature, 1947) and a collection of some of the 900 letters between her and her imprisoned husband Juninen no tegami (Letters of Twelve Years, 1950\u20131952).\nPolitical and social views\nMiyamoto was unique in her combination of socialism and feminism. In both movements, she considered it imperative that individuals seeks self-fulfillment. Her debut novel Nobuko explores in detail what it means to seek fulfillment and at what point it might be acceptable to violate social norms and combat \"social issues\" in its pursuit.In contrast to many feminists at the time, Miyamoto resisted the advancement of women in \"womanly fields.\" Her work was rejected early in her career from popular women's magazine Fujin K\u014dron (Women's Forum) for being \"too difficult;\" however, Miyamoto took it as a compliment, interpreting that her work was \"too masculine.\" She resisted the popular idea of jory\u016b (\"feminine writing\"), which held that women's and men's writing styles were fundamentally different. After a series of journalistic scandals in women's magazine Seit\u014d (\"Bluestockings\"), she believed her work would be better able to stand on its literary merit in general-reading magazines.In contrast to many proletarian writers at the time, who tended to focus on male bonding and the situations of working men, Miyamoto focused on working-class women and the role of female bonding. She considered women's liberation a part of the path to better social order, pushing against both traditional proletarian literature and mainstream Japanese thought.As a member of the proletarian movement, Miyamoto was anti-imperialist (imperialism being the highest stage of capitalism); however, her work contradicts proletarian stereotypes by featuring urban centers and certain wealthy individuals as civilizing forces for outside groups. Certain of her works also locate revolutionary action within the family unit, contrary to most conceptions of both revolution and liberation at the time.\nSelected works\nNovels\nNobuko (Nobuko, 1928)\nBansh\u016b heiya (The Banshu Plain, 1947)\nF\u016bchis\u014d (The Weathervane Plant, 1947)\nFutatsa no niwa (The Two Gardens, 1948)\nD\u014dhy\u014d (Landmark, 1950)Short stories\n\"N\u014dson\" (\"A Farming Village\", 1915)\n\"Mazushiki hitobito no mure\" (\"A Flock of Poor People\", 1916)\n\"Ippon no hana\" (\"One Flower\", 1927)\n\"1932-nen no haru\" (\"The Spring of 1932\", 1932)\n\"Kokukoku\" (\"Movement by Movement\", 1933)\n\"Chibusa\" (\"The Breasts\", 1935)Nonfiction\n\"Utagoe yo okore\" (\"Oh, Rise Up Our Song!\", 1946)\nFujin to bungaku (Women and Literature, 1948)\nJ\u016bni nen no tegami (The Letters of Twelve Years, 1952)Portrayals\nYuriko, Dasvidaniya is a 2011 drama film, depicting a brief period in 1924, in which Hitomi Toi plays the title role.

Born in Russia, he wrote his first nine novels in Russian (1926\u20131938) while living in Berlin. He achieved international acclaim and prominence after moving to the United States and beginning to write in English. Nabokov became an American citizen in 1945, but he and his wife returned to Europe in 1961, settling in Montreux, Switzerland.\nNabokov's Lolita (1955) was ranked fourth in the list of the Modern Library 100 Best Novels in 2007; Pale Fire (1962) was ranked 53rd on the same list; and his memoir, Speak, Memory (1951), was listed eighth on publisher Random House's list of the 20th century's greatest nonfiction. He was a seven-time finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction.\nNabokov was also an expert lepidopterist and composer of chess problems.\n\nLife and career\nRussia\nNabokov was born on 22 April 1899 (10 April 1899 Old Style) in Saint Petersburg to a wealthy and prominent family of the Russian nobility. His family traced its roots to the 14th-century Tatar prince Nabok Murza, who entered into the service of the Tsars, and from whom the family name is derived. His father was Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov (1870\u20131922), a liberal lawyer, statesman, and journalist, and his mother was the heiress Yelena Ivanovna n\u00e9e Rukavishnikova, the granddaughter of a millionaire gold-mine owner. His father was a leader of the pre-Revolutionary liberal Constitutional Democratic Party, and wrote numerous books and articles about criminal law and politics. His cousins included the composer Nicolas Nabokov. His paternal grandfather, Dmitry Nabokov (1827\u20131904), was Russia's Justice Minister during the reign of Alexander II. His paternal grandmother was the Baltic German Baroness Maria von Korff (1842\u20131926). Through his father's German ancestry, Nabokov was related to the composer Carl Heinrich Graun (1704\u20131759).Vladimir was the family's eldest and favorite child, with four younger siblings: Sergey (1900\u201345), Olga (1903\u201378), Elena (1906\u20132000), and Kirill (1912\u201364). Sergey was killed in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945 after publicly denouncing Hitler's regime. Writer Ayn Rand recalled Olga (her close friend at Stoiunina Gymnasium) as a supporter of constitutional monarchy who first awakened Rand's interest in politics. Elena, who in later years became Vladimir's favorite sibling, published her correspondence with him in 1985. She was an important source for later biographers of Nabokov.\nNabokov spent his childhood and youth in Saint Petersburg and at the country estate Vyra near Siverskaya, south of the city. His childhood, which he called \"perfect\" and \"cosmopolitan\", was remarkable in several ways. The family spoke Russian, English, and French in their household, and Nabokov was trilingual from an early age. He related that the first English book his mother read to him was Misunderstood (1869) by Florence Montgomery. Much to his patriotic father's disappointment, Nabokov could read and write in English before he could in Russian. In his memoir Speak, Memory, Nabokov recalls numerous details of his privileged childhood. His ability to recall in vivid detail memories of his past was a boon to him during his permanent exile, providing a theme that runs from his first book Mary to later works such as Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle. While the family was nominally Orthodox, it had little religious fervor. Vladimir was not forced to attend church after he lost interest.\nIn 1916, Nabokov inherited the estate Rozhdestveno, next to Vyra, from his uncle Vasily Ivanovich Rukavishnikov (\"Uncle Ruka\" in Speak, Memory). He lost it in the October Revolution one year later; this was the only house he ever owned.\nNabokov's adolescence was the period in which he made his first serious literary endeavors. In 1916, he published his first book, Stikhi (\"Poems\"), a collection of 68 Russian poems. At the time he was attending Tenishev school in Saint Petersburg, where his literature teacher Vladimir Vasilievich Gippius had criticized his literary accomplishments. Some time after the publication of Stikhi, Zinaida Gippius, renowned poet and first cousin of his teacher, told Nabokov's father at a social event, \"Please tell your son that he will never be a writer.\"\nEmigration\nAfter the 1917 February Revolution, Nabokov's father became a secretary of the Russian Provisional Government in Saint Petersburg. After the October Revolution, the family was forced to flee the city for Crimea, at first not expecting to be away for very long. They lived at a friend's estate and in September 1918 moved to Livadiya, at the time part of the Ukrainian Republic. Nabokov's father became a minister of justice in the Crimean Regional Government.\nAfter the withdrawal of the German Army in November 1918 and the defeat of the White Army (early 1919), the Nabokovs sought exile in western Europe, along with many other Russian refugees. They settled briefly in England, where Vladimir enrolled in Trinity College of the University of Cambridge, first studying zoology, then Slavic and Romance languages. His examination results on the first part of the Tripos, taken at the end of second year, were a starred first. He sat the second part of the exam in his fourth year, just after his father's death. Nabokov feared he might fail the exam, but his script was marked second-class. His final examination result was second-class, and his BA conferred in 1922. Nabokov later drew on his Cambridge experiences to write several works, including the novels Glory and The Real Life of Sebastian Knight.\nIn 1920, Nabokov's family moved to Berlin, where his father set up the \u00e9migr\u00e9 newspaper Rul' (\"Rudder\"). Nabokov followed them to Berlin two years later, after completing his studies at Cambridge.\n\nBerlin years (1922\u201337)\nIn March 1922, Nabokov's father was fatally shot in Berlin by Russian monarchists Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork and Sergey Taboritsky as he was trying to shield the real target, Pavel Milyukov, a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party-in-exile. Nabokov featured this mistaken, violent death repeatedly in his fiction, where characters would meet their deaths under accidental terms. (On one interpretation of his novel Pale Fire, for example, an assassin mistakenly kills the poet John Shade when his actual target is a fugitive European monarch.) Shortly after his father's death, Nabokov's mother and sister moved to Prague.\nNabokov stayed in Berlin, where he had become a recognised poet and writer in Russian within the \u00e9migr\u00e9 community; he published under the nom de plume V. Sirin (a reference to the fabulous bird of Russian folklore). To supplement his scant writing income, he taught languages and gave tennis and boxing lessons. Of his 15 Berlin years, Dieter E. Zimmer has written: \"He never became fond of Berlin, and at the end intensely disliked it. He lived within the lively Russian community of Berlin that was more or less self-sufficient, staying on after it had disintegrated because he had nowhere else to go to. He knew little German. He knew few Germans except for landladies, shopkeepers, and immigration officials at the police headquarters.\"In 1922, Nabokov became engaged to Svetlana Siewert; she broke off the engagement in early 1923, her parents worrying that he could not provide for her. In May 1923, he met V\u00e9ra Evseyevna Slonim, a Russian-Jewish woman, at a charity ball in Berlin. They married in April 1925. Their only child, Dmitri, was born in 1934.\nIn 1936, V\u00e9ra lost her job because of the increasingly anti-Semitic environment. That year the assassin of Nabokov's father was appointed second-in-command of the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 group. In the same year, Nabokov began seeking a job in the English-speaking world. In 1937, he left Germany for France, where he had a short affair with Irina Guadanini, also a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9e. His family followed him to France, making en route their last visit to Prague, then spent time in Cannes, Menton, Cap d'Antibes, and Fr\u00e9jus, finally settling in Paris. This city also had a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 community.\nIn May 1940, the Nabokovs fled the advancing German troops, reaching the United States via the SS Champlain. Nabokov's brother Sergei did not leave France, and he died at the Neuengamme concentration camp on 9 January 1945.\nUnited States\nThe Nabokovs settled in Manhattan and Vladimir began volunteer work as an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History.Nabokov joined the staff of Wellesley College in 1941 as resident lecturer in comparative literature. The position, created specifically for him, provided an income and free time to write creatively and pursue his lepidoptery. Nabokov is remembered as the founder of Wellesley's Russian Department. The Nabokovs resided in Wellesley, Massachusetts, during the 1941\u201342 academic year. In September 1942 they moved to Cambridge, where they lived until June 1948. Following a lecture tour through the United States, Nabokov returned to Wellesley for the 1944\u201345 academic year as a lecturer in Russian. In 1945, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He served through the 1947\u201348 term as Wellesley's one-man Russian Department, offering courses in Russian language and literature. His classes were popular, due as much to his unique teaching style as to the wartime interest in all things Russian. At the same time he was the de facto curator of lepidoptery at Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology. After being encouraged by Morris Bishop, Nabokov left Wellesley in 1948 to teach Russian and European literature at Cornell University, where he taught until 1959. Among his students at Cornell was future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who later identified Nabokov as a major influence on her development as a writer.Nabokov wrote Lolita while travelling on the butterfly-collection trips in the western United States that he undertook every summer. V\u00e9ra acted as \"secretary, typist, editor, proofreader, translator and bibliographer; his agent, business manager, legal counsel and chauffeur; his research assistant, teaching assistant and professorial understudy\"; when Nabokov attempted to burn unfinished drafts of Lolita, V\u00e9ra stopped him. He called her the best-humored woman he had ever known.In June 1953 Nabokov and his family went to Ashland, Oregon. There he finished Lolita and began writing the novel Pnin. He roamed the nearby mountains looking for butterflies, and wrote a poem called Lines Written in Oregon. On 1 October 1953, he and his family returned to Ithaca, New York, where he would later teach the young writer Thomas Pynchon.\nMontreux and death\nAfter the great financial success of Lolita, Nabokov returned to Europe and devoted himself to writing. In 1961 he and V\u00e9ra moved to the Montreux Palace Hotel in Montreux, Switzerland; he stayed there until the end of his life. From his sixth-floor quarters he conducted his business and took tours to the Alps, Corsica, and Sicily to hunt butterflies. He died on 2 July 1977 in Montreux. His remains were cremated and buried at the Clarens cemetery in Montreux.At the time of his death, he was working on a novel titled The Original of Laura. V\u00e9ra and Dmitri, who were entrusted with Nabokov's literary executorship, ignored Nabokov\u2019s request to burn the incomplete manuscript and published it in 2009.\nWork\nNabokov is known as one of the leading prose stylists of the 20th century; his first writings were in Russian, but he achieved his greatest fame with the novels he wrote in the English language. As a trilingual (also writing in French, see Mademoiselle O) master, he has been compared to Joseph Conrad; Nabokov, however, disliked both the comparison and Conrad's work. He lamented to the critic Edmund Wilson, \"I am too old to change Conradically\" \u2013 which John Updike later called, \"itself a jest of genius\". This lament came in 1941, when Nabokov had been an apprentice American for less than one year.  Later in a November 1950 Wilson letter, Nabokov offers a solid, non-comic appraisal: \"Conrad knew how to handle readymade English better than I; but I know better the other kind. He never sinks to the depths of my solecisms, but neither does he scale my verbal peaks.\" Nabokov translated many of his own early works into English, sometimes in cooperation with his son Dmitri. His trilingual upbringing had a profound influence on his artistry.\nNabokov himself translated into Russian two books that he had originally written in English, Conclusive Evidence and Lolita. The \"translation\" of Conclusive Evidence was made because of Nabokov's feeling of imperfections in the English version. Writing the book, he noted that he needed to translate his own memories into English, and to spend a lot of time explaining things that are well known in Russia; then he decided to re-write the book once again, in his first native language, and after that he made the final version, Speak, Memory (Nabokov first wanted to name it \"Speak, Mnemosyne\"). Nabokov was a proponent of individualism, and rejected concepts and ideologies that curtailed individual freedom and expression, such as totalitarianism in its various forms, as well as Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis. Poshlost, or as he transcribed it, poshlust, is disdained and frequently mocked in his works. On translating Lolita, Nabokov writes, \"I imagined that in some distant future somebody might produce a Russian version of Lolita. I trained my inner telescope upon that particular point in the distant future and I saw that every paragraph, pock-marked as it is with pitfalls, could lend itself to hideous mistranslation. In the hands of a harmful drudge, the Russian version of Lolita would be entirely degraded and botched by vulgar paraphrases or blunders. So I decided to translate it myself.\"Nabokov's creative processes involved writing sections of text on hundreds of index cards, which he expanded into paragraphs and chapters and rearranged to form the structure of his novels, a process that has been adopted by many screenplay writers in subsequent years.Nabokov published under the pseudonym \"Vladimir Sirin\" in the 1920s to 1940s, occasionally to mask his identity from critics. He also makes cameo appearances in some of his novels, such as the character \"Vivian Darkbloom\" (an anagram of \"Vladimir Nabokov\"), who appears in both Lolita and Ada, or Ardor, and the character Blavdak Vinomori (another anagram of Nabokov's name) in King, Queen, Knave. Sirin is referenced as a different \u00e9migr\u00e9 author in his memoir and is also referenced in Pnin.\nNabokov is noted for his complex plots, clever word play, daring metaphors, and prose style capable of both parody and intense lyricism. He gained both fame and notoriety with his novel Lolita (1955), which tells of a grown man's devouring passion for a twelve-year-old girl. This and his other novels, particularly Pale Fire (1962), won him a place among the greatest novelists of the 20th century. His longest novel, which met with a mixed response, is Ada (1969). He devoted more time to the composition of this novel than any of his others. Nabokov's fiction is characterized by linguistic playfulness. For example, his short story \"The Vane Sisters\" is famous in part for its acrostic final paragraph, in which the first letters of each word spell out a message from beyond the grave. In another of his short stories, \"Signs and Symbols\" (1958), Nabokov creates a character suffering from an imaginary illness called \"Referential Mania,\" in which the afflicted is faced with a world of environmental objects exchanging coded messages.\nNabokov's stature as a literary critic is founded largely on his four-volume translation and commentary for Alexander Pushkin's novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, published in 1964. That commentary ended with an appendix titled Notes on Prosody, which has developed a reputation of its own. It stemmed from his observation that while Pushkin's iambic tetrameters had been a part of Russian literature for a fairly short two centuries, they were clearly understood by the Russian prosodists. On the other hand, he viewed the much older English iambic tetrameters as muddled and poorly documented. In his own words:I have been forced to invent a simple little terminology of my own, explain its application to English verse forms, and indulge in certain rather copious details of classification before even tackling the limited object of these notes to my translation of Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, an object that boils down to very little\u2014in comparison to the forced preliminaries\u2014namely, to a few things that the non-Russian student of Russian literature must know in regard to Russian prosody in general and to Eugene Onegin in particular.\nNabokov's lectures at Cornell University, as collected in Lectures on Literature, reveal his controversial ideas concerning art. He firmly believed that novels should not aim to teach and that readers should not merely empathize with characters but that a 'higher' aesthetic enjoyment should be attained, partly by paying great attention to details of style and structure. He detested what he saw as 'general ideas' in novels, and so when teaching Ulysses, for example, he would insist students keep an eye on where the characters were in Dublin (with the aid of a map) rather than teaching the complex Irish history that many critics see as being essential to an understanding of the novel. In 2010, Kitsch magazine, a student publication at Cornell, published a piece that focused on student reflections on his lectures and also explored Nabokov's long relationship with Playboy. Nabokov also wanted his students to describe the details of the novels rather than a narrative of the story and was very strict when it came to grading. As Edward Jay Epstein described his experience in Nabokov's classes, Nabokov made it clear from the very first lectures that he had little interest in fraternizing with students, who would be known not by their name but by their seat number.\nSynesthesia\nNabokov was a self-described synesthete, who at a young age equated the number five with the colour red. Aspects of synesthesia can be found in several of his works. His wife also exhibited synesthesia; like her husband, her mind's eye associated colours with particular letters. They discovered that Dmitri shared the trait, and moreover that the colours he associated with some letters were in some cases blends of his parents' hues\u2014\"which is as if genes were painting in aquarelle\".For some synesthetes, letters are not simply associated with certain colors, they are themselves colored. Nabokov frequently endowed his protagonists with a similar gift. In Bend Sinister Krug comments on his perception of the word \"loyalty\" as being like a golden fork lying out in the sun. In The Defense, Nabokov mentioned briefly how the main character's father, a writer, found he was unable to complete a novel that he planned to write, becoming lost in the fabricated storyline by \"starting with colors\".  Many other subtle references are made in Nabokov's writing that can be traced back to his synesthesia. Many of his characters have a distinct \"sensory appetite\" reminiscent of synesthesia.\nEntomology\nNabokov's interest in entomology had been\ninspired by books of Maria Sibylla Merian he had found in the attic of his family's country home in Vyra. Throughout an extensive career of collecting he never learned to drive a car, and he depended on his wife V\u00e9ra to take him to collecting sites. During the 1940s, as a research fellow in zoology, he was responsible for organizing the butterfly collection of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. His writings in this area were highly technical. This, combined with his specialty in the relatively unspectacular tribe Polyommatini of the family Lycaenidae, has left this facet of his life little explored by most admirers of his literary works. He described the Karner blue. The genus Nabokovia was named after him in honor of this work, as were a number of butterfly and moth species (e.g., many species in the genera Madeleinea and Pseudolucia bear epithets alluding to Nabokov or names from his novels). In 1967, Nabokov commented: \"The pleasures and rewards of literary inspiration are nothing beside the rapture of discovering a new organ under the microscope or an undescribed species on a mountainside in Iran or Peru. It is not improbable that had there been no revolution in Russia, I would have devoted myself entirely to lepidopterology and never written any novels at all.\"The paleontologist and essayist Stephen Jay Gould discussed Nabokov's lepidoptery in his essay, \"No Science Without Fancy, No Art Without Facts: The Lepidoptery of Vladimir Nabokov\" (reprinted in I Have Landed). Gould notes that Nabokov was occasionally a scientific \"stick-in-the-mud\". For example, Nabokov never accepted that genetics or the counting of chromosomes could be a valid way to distinguish species of insects, and relied on the traditional (for lepidopterists) microscopic comparison of their genitalia.\nThe Harvard Museum of Natural History, which now contains the Museum of Comparative Zoology, still possesses Nabokov's \"genitalia cabinet\", where the author stored his collection of male blue butterfly genitalia. \"Nabokov was a serious taxonomist,\" says museum staff writer Nancy Pick, author of The Rarest of the Rare: Stories Behind the Treasures at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. \"He actually did quite a good job at distinguishing species that you would not think were different\u2014by looking at their genitalia under a microscope six hours a day, seven days a week, until his eyesight was permanently impaired.\" The rest of his collection, about 4,300 specimens, was given to the Lausanne's Museum of Zoology in Switzerland.\nThough his work was not taken seriously by professional lepidopterists during his life, new genetic research supports Nabokov's hypothesis that a group of butterfly species, called the Polyommatus blues, came to the New World over the Bering Strait in five waves, eventually reaching Chile.Many of Nabokov's fans have tried to ascribe literary value to his scientific papers, Gould notes. Conversely, others have claimed that his scientific work enriched his literary output. Gould advocates a third view, holding that the other two positions are examples of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. Rather than assuming that either side of Nabokov's work caused or stimulated the other, Gould proposes that both stemmed from Nabokov's love of detail, contemplation, and symmetry.\n\nChess problems\nNabokov spent considerable time during his exile composing chess problems, which he published in Germany's Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 press, Poems and Problems (18 problems) and Speak, Memory (one). He describes the process of composing and constructing in his memoir: \"The strain on the mind is formidable; the element of time drops out of one's consciousness\". To him, the \"originality, invention, conciseness, harmony, complexity, and splendid insincerity\" of creating a chess problem was similar to that in any other art.\n\nPolitics and views\nRussian politics\nRussia has always been a curiously unpleasant country despite her great literature. Unfortunately, Russians today have completely lost their ability to kill tyrants.\nNabokov was a classical liberal, in the tradition of his father, a liberal statesman who served in the Provisional Government following the February Revolution of 1917 as a member of the Constitutional Democratic Party. In Speak, Memory, Nabokov proudly recounted his father's campaigns against despotism and staunch opposition to capital punishment. Nabokov was a self-proclaimed \"White Russian\", and was, from its inception, a strong opponent of the Soviet government that came to power following the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917.  In a poem he wrote as a teenager in 1917, he described Lenin's Bolsheviks as \"grey rag-tag people\".Throughout his life, Nabokov would remain committed to the classical liberal political philosophy of his father, and equally opposed Tsarist autocracy, communism, and fascism.Nabokov's father Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov was the most outspoken defender of Jewish rights in the Russian Empire, continuing in a family tradition that had been led by his own father, Dmitry Nabokov, who as Justice Minister under Tsar Alexander II had successfully blocked anti-semitic measures from being passed by the Interior Minister.  That family strain would continue in Vladimir Nabokov, who fiercely denounced anti-semitism in his writings, and in the 1930s Nabokov was able to escape Hitler's Germany only with the help of Russian Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s who still had grateful memories of his family's defense of Jews in Tsarist times.When asked, in 1969, whether he would like to revisit the land he had fled in 1918, now the Soviet Union, he replied: \"There's nothing to look at.  New tenement houses and old churches do not interest me.  The hotels there are terrible. I detest the Soviet theater. Any palace in Italy is superior to the repainted abodes of the Tsars.  The village huts in the forbidden hinterland are as dismally poor as ever, and the wretched peasant flogs his wretched cart horse with the same wretched zest. As to my special northern landscape and the haunts of my childhood \u2013 well, I would not wish to contaminate their images preserved in my mind.\"\nAmerican politics\nIn the 1940s, as an \u00e9migr\u00e9 in America, Nabokov would stress the connection between American and English liberal democracy and the aspirations of the short-lived Russian provisional government. In 1942 he declared: \"Democracy is humanity at its best ... it is the natural condition of every man ever since the human mind became conscious not only of the world but of itself.\" During the 1960s, in both letters and interviews, he reveals a profound contempt for the New Left movements, describing the protesters as \"conformists\" and \"goofy hoodlums.\" In a 1967 interview, Nabokov stated that he refused to associate with supporters of Bolshevism or Tsarist autocracy but that he had \"friends among intellectual constitutional monarchists as well as among intellectual social revolutionaries.\" Nabokov supported the Vietnam War effort and voiced admiration for both Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon. Racism against African-Americans appalled Nabokov, who touted Alexander Pushkin's multiracial background as an argument against segregation.\nReligion\nIn his religious views, Nabokov was an agnostic. Nabokov was very open about, and received criticism over, his utter indifference to organized mysticism, to religion, and to the church\u2014any church.\nSleep\nNabokov was a notorious, lifelong insomniac who admitted unease at the prospect of sleep, famously stating that \"the night is always a giant\". His insomnia contributed to an enlarged prostate later in life, which only exacerbated his sleeplessness. Nabokov called sleep a \"moronic fraternity\", \"mental torture\", and a \"nightly betrayal of reason, humanity, genius\". Insomnia's impact on his work was widely explored and in 2017 Princeton University Press published a compilation of his dream diary entries, Insomniac Dreams: Experiments with Time by Vladimir Nabokov.\nViews on women writers\nNabokov's wife V\u00e9ra was his strongest supporter and assisted him throughout his lifetime, but Nabokov admitted to having a \"prejudice\" against women writers. He wrote to Edmund Wilson, who had been making suggestions for his lectures: \"I dislike Jane Austen, and am prejudiced, in fact against all women writers. They are in another class.\" But after rereading Austen's Mansfield Park he changed his mind and taught it in his literature course; he also praised Mary McCarthy's work. Although V\u00e9ra worked as his personal translator and secretary, he made publicly known that his ideal translator would be male, and especially not a \"Russian-born female\". In the first chapter of Glory he attributes the protagonist's similar prejudice to the impressions made by children's writers like Lidiya Charski, and in the short story \"The Admiralty Spire\" deplores the posturing, snobbery, antisemitism, and cutesiness he considered characteristic of Russian women authors.\nInfluence\nThe Russian literary critic Yuly Aykhenvald was an early admirer of Nabokov, citing in particular his ability to imbue objects with life: \"he saturates trivial things with life, sense and psychology and gives a mind to objects; his refined senses notice colorations and nuances, smells and sounds, and everything acquires an unexpected meaning and truth under his gaze and through his words.\" The critic James Wood argued that Nabokov's use of descriptive detail proved an \"overpowering, and not always very fruitful, influence on two or three generations after him\", including authors such as Martin Amis and John Updike. While a student at Cornell in the 1950s, Thomas Pynchon attended several of Nabokov's lectures and alluded to Lolita in chapter six of his novel The Crying of Lot 49 (1966) in which Serge, counter-tenor in the band the Paranoids, sings:\n\nWhat chance has a lonely surfer boy\nFor the love of a surfer chick,\nWith all these Humbert Humbert cats\nComing on so big and sick?\nFor me, my baby was a woman,\nFor him she's just another nymphet.It has also been argued that Pynchon's prose style is influenced by Nabokov's preference for actualism over realism. Of the authors who came to prominence during Nabokov's lifetime, John Banville, Don DeLillo, Salman Rushdie, and Edmund White were all influenced by him. The novelist John Hawkes took inspiration from Nabokov and considered himself his follower. Nabokov's story \"Signs and Symbols\" was on the reading list for Hawkes's writing students at Brown University. \"A writer who truly and greatly sustains us is Vladimir Nabokov,\" Hawkes stated in a 1964 interview.Several authors who came to prominence in the 1990s and 2000s have also cited Nabokov's work as a literary influence. Aleksandar Hemon, whose high-wire wordplay and sense of the absurd are often compared to Nabokov's, has acknowledged the latter's impact on his writing. Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon listed Lolita and Pale Fire among the \"books that, I thought, changed my life when I read them,\" and stated that \"Nabokov's English combines aching lyricism with dispassionate precision in a way that seems to render every human emotion in all its intensity but never with an ounce of schmaltz or soggy language\". Pulitzer Prize winner Jeffrey Eugenides said that \"Nabokov has always been and remains one of my favorite writers. He's able to juggle ten balls where most people can juggle three or four.\"  T. Coraghessan Boyle said that \"Nabokov's playfulness and the ravishing beauty of his prose are ongoing influences\" on his writing, and Marisha Pessl has also been influenced by Nabokov.Nabokov appears in W. G. Sebald's 1993 novel The Emigrants.\nAdaptations\nThe song cycle \"Sing, Poetry\" on the 2011 contemporary classical album Troika comprises settings of Russian and English versions of three of Nabokov's poems by such composers as Jay Greenberg, Michael Schelle and Lev Zhurbin.\n\nList of works\nNotes\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nBiography\nCriticism\n\nBibliography\nJuliar, Michael.

He was awarded the Prix Goncourt for L'Ordre in 1929, and was elected to the French academy in 1968.  He directed the Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise from 1968\u20131977.\n\nReferences\nArland is referenced by Deleuze & Guattari in Chapter 8 of A Thousand Plateaus. They cite Arland's 1944 work 'Le Promeneur' where he describes the novella as \"nothing but pure lines right down to the nuances, and nothing but the pure and conscious power of the word\". Arland's view of the novella form accords with Deleuze and Guattari's: that it consists of abstract lines (connections) that constitute subjects and entities by relating them to one another. \nWorks\nTerres \u00e9trang\u00e8res (1923)\n\u00c9tienne (1925)\nMonique (1926)\nLes \u00c2mes en peine (1927)\nL'Ordre (1929) (Prix Goncourt)\nAntar\u00e8s (1932)\nLes Vivants (1934)\nLa Vigie (1935)\nLes Plus Beaux de nos jours (1937)\nTerre natale (1938)\nLa Gr\u00e2ce (1941)\nZ\u00e9lie dans le d\u00e9sert (1944)\nIl faut de tout pour faire un monde (1947)\nSidobre (1949)\nEssais et nouveaux essais critiques (1952)\nJe vous \u00e9cris...
